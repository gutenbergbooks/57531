<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;NO ONE,&#8221; snapped Keturah Smiley, &#8220;can play
Providence to a married couple.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some women can play Lucifer,&#8221; retorted her
brother. His hoarse but not unmusical voice shook
with anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had nothing to do with your wife&#8217;s running away,&#8221;
Keturah Smiley answered. &#8220;What is this child you
have adopted?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have adopted no child,&#8221; said Cap&#8217;n John Smiley
with coldness. &#8220;A child was saved from the wreck of
the <i>Mermaid</i> and the men at the station have adopted
her. The fancy struck them and&mdash;I certainly had no
objection. It&#8217;s&mdash;she&#8217;s&mdash;a girl, a little girl of about six.
We don&#8217;t know her name. The men are calling her
Mermaid after the ship.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keturah Smiley sniffed. She wrapped the man&#8217;s
coat she wore more closely about her, and made as if to
return to her gardening.</p>

<p>Her brother eyed her with a wrathful blue eye. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
never saw her that they did not quarrel. He was
aware that, deep down, she loved him; he was aware
that it was this jealous love of Keturah&#8217;s which had
caused her to nag the young girl he had married some
seven years earlier. Mary Rogers, in Keturah&#8217;s eyes,
was a silly, thoughtless, flighty person quite unfitted to
fill the rôle of John Smiley&#8217;s wife and the mother of
John Smiley&#8217;s children. She must be made to feel
this; Keturah had done her best to make her feel it.
And there could be no question that the young wife had
felt it. So much so that, joined to John Smiley&#8217;s long
absences on duty at the Coast Guard station on the
beach, joined to her loneliness, joined to who knows
what secret doubts and anguish, she had disappeared
one day some months after their child was born, taking
the baby girl with her and leaving no word, no note, no
token. And she had never come back. She had
never been traced. She might be dead; the child
might be dead; no one knew.</p>

<p>Of course this was the crowning evidence of the unfitness
Keturah Smiley had found in her; but somehow
Keturah Smiley did not make that triumphant point
before her brother. It is possible that Keturah
Smiley who wore a man&#8217;s old coat, who drove hard
bargains at better than six per cent., whose tongue
made the Long Islanders of Blue Port shrink as under
a cutting lash&mdash;it is possible that Keturah Smiley was
just the least bit afraid of her brother.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>If so she could hardly be said to show it. There
was no trace of the stricken conscience in the air
with which she always faced him. There was none
now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, John,&#8221; she said, almost pleasantly, as she hoed
her onion bed. &#8220;You&#8217;re blowing from the southeast
pretty strong to-day and you appear to be bringing
trouble. I&#8217;ll just take three reefs in my temper and
listen to what further you have to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>John Smiley was not heeding her. He had found
that there are times in life when it is necessary not to
listen if you would keep sane and kind. He was reflecting
on the difficulty of his errand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keturah,&#8221; he asked, off-handedly, &#8220;this little girl
has got to have some clothes. Do you suppose&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you would like me to adopt her,&#8221; his sister
interrupted. &#8220;No, I thank you, John. As for clothes,
I daresay that if you and your men are going to bring
up a six-year-old girl the lot of you can get clothes from
somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>Do we always torture the things we love? Love and
jealousy, jealousy and torture. Cap&#8217;n Smiley saw red
for a moment; then he turned on his heel and strode
down the path and out the gate.</p>

<p>He walked up the long main street until he came to
the handful of stores at the crossroads. Entering one
of the largest he went to the counter where a pleasant-faced
woman confronted him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, Cap&#8217;n Smiley!&#8221; exclaimed the shopwoman.
&#8220;Are you all right? Are all the men all right? What
a terrible time you <i>have</i> been a-having! That ship&mdash;she&#8217;s
pounded all to pieces they say.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Coast Guard keeper nodded. He began his errand:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to get some clothes for a little girl that was
saved&mdash;only one we got ashore alive except one of the
hands. I guess I need a complete outfit for a six-year-old,&#8221;
he explained.</p>

<p>The shopwoman, with various exclamations, bustled
about. She spread out on the counter a variety of
garments. The keeper eyed them with some confusion.
It appeared he had to make a selection; impossible task!
&#8220;What would you think was best?&#8221; he inquired,
anxiously. The shopwoman came to his aid and a
bundle was made up. Two little gingham dresses, a
warm coat; and did he want a nice dress? A dress-up
dress? The keeper had given no thought to the matter.
A pity the little girl wasn&#8217;t along! It was hard to tell
what would become her. She had blue eyes and reddish
hair? Something dark and plain, but not too
dark. A plaid; yes, a warm plaid would be best. Here
was a nice pattern.</p>

<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose you&#8217;ll be bringing her over here,&#8221; ventured
the shopkeeper. &#8220;Does any one know who she
is?... What a pity! Mermaid! After the ship!
I declare. I don&#8217;t know&#8217;s I ever heard that for a girl&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
name, though it&#8217;s suitable, to be sure. I s&#8217;pose you&#8217;ll
look after her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The&mdash;the men have sort of adopted her,&#8221; Cap&#8217;n
Smiley said, hastily. &#8220;We thought we could look after
her and it would be rather nice having a youngster
around. Of course, it&#8217;s unusual,&#8221; he went on in answer
to the shopwoman&#8217;s expression of amazement. He
thanked her, and taking his bundles, fared forth.</p>

<p>The woman in the shop sent after him a curious
and softened look. She had a habit of saying aloud
the things that struck her most forcibly. She remarked
now to the empty store:</p>

<p>&#8220;Adopt her! Well, there&#8217;s those will say a crew of
Coast Guardsmen are no fit lot to bring up a six-year-old
girl. But any child will be safe with John Smiley
to look after her.&#8221; A new and important thought
struck her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodness!&#8221; she ejaculated. &#8220;This will be something
for Keturah to exercise her brain about!&#8221;</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Cap&#8217;n Smiley went from the shop directly to the
creek where his boat lay. He stowed his bundles and
gave several energetic turns to the flywheel; the engine
began to chug loudly, the keeper cast off his line, and
taking the tiller started back across the Great South
Bay.</p>

<p>It was a five-mile trip across to the Lone Cove Coast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Guard Station and Keeper John had a little time for
reflection. He had not meant to quarrel with his
sister; he had gone with the express determination not
to have the usual row, but this had proved impossible.
No one could avoid fighting with his sister, himself
least of all. If it was not some allusion to his wife it
was some allusion to their aunt&#8217;s will which, drawn to
leave her considerable property equally to John and
his sister, had at the last moment been altered to leave
all to Keturah because of dissatisfaction with John&#8217;s
marriage. The keeper had never cared about that
while he had had his wife and for a few precious
months the baby girl; and after he had lost them it
would seem he might have cared less than ever. What
was money then? Never-ceasing pain still gnawed
at his heart, but for that very reason the gibes of his
sister became the more unendurable. Was it not she
who was in great measure responsible for the loss of
Mary and the little Mary? Cap&#8217;n Smiley was a clear-minded
man; he did not absolve his wife from blame,
but she had been, after all, but a young girl and
despite her lightmindedness he had loved her. With
all her little affectations, with all her craving for amusement,
with all her utter inefficiency as a housekeeper,
with all her childishness akin to that of the childlike
Dora whom David Copperfield cherished&mdash;with all and
in spite of all John Smiley had loved this young girl.
And he could not but believe that his sister was as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
much to blame for her behaviour in leaving him as
Mary&#8217;s own weak nature.</p>

<p>And then the baby girl! How deep the wound of
losing her John Smiley would never let the world know.
Her name, too, had been Mary.</p>

<p>He thought of the mute little figure awaiting him and
his bundles on the beach. She was just the age, as
nearly as could be surmised, that his own child would
have been if ... if....</p>

<p>What was that his sister had said in regard to his
own experience? &#8220;No one can play Providence to a
married couple.&#8221; Well, a pretty thing for her to say!
She had certainly played a rôle anything but providential
in her brother&#8217;s marriage. But if no one could
play Providence to married folk it might still be
possible for someone to be a Providence to a single
soul.</p>

<p>This little girl, he thought with a thrill, this little
girl of the age his own would have been, with her blue
eyes and her reddish hair, coppery, almost burnished&mdash;she
could play Providence in his life, perhaps.</p>

<p>He remembered how, the night of the wreck, he had
put her to bed in his own bed and had slept in some
blankets on the floor. In the middle of the night he
had been wakened by her crying. Some memory in
her sleep had made her sob. Very weak, pitiful sobs.
They had stirred him to try to comfort her and after
a little she had returned to sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>There was in the crew of the Lone Cove Coast
Guard Station a man named Hosea Hand and
called Ho Ha, partly because these were the first
letters of his first and last names, partly because of
the presence among the crew of another man called
Ha Ha. Ha Ha&#8217;s name was Harvey Hawley and he
was a silent, sorrowful, drooping figure. He resembled
a gloomy question mark and not a joyful exclamation
point. Ho Ha, however, was merry; Ho Ha was
blithe and gay. Ha Ha, in the week of the six-year-old
child&#8217;s existence at Lone Cove, had hardly done more
than eye her with misgiving. But Ho Ha had picked
her up a dozen times a day for little journeys down to
the surf, back to the station, over to the bay, and up on
the dunes. He had her now, pick-a-back, at the end of
the little pier that stuck out into the bay shallows.
The chugging of the keeper&#8217;s launch grew louder every
minute.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wave to the Cap&#8217;n,&#8221; Ho Ha urged her. Mermaid
answered his smile with a smile of her own. The afternoon
sun struck her coppery hair and framed the smile
in a halo.</p>

<p>Of a sudden the chug-chugging stopped, the launch
came about neatly, and Ho Ha, hastily setting Mermaid
down on the pier, caught the rope end Cap&#8217;n Smiley
tossed him. Then he laid hold of the keeper&#8217;s bundles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
while John Smiley picked up the little girl and carried
her to the station.</p>

<p>Spring had not conquered the chill of nightfall yet.
The big stove in the long living room of the station gave
forth a happy warmth, and the front lids were red. In
the kitchen, through which arrivals passed into the living
room, Warren Avery, Surfman No. 4, was working,
apron-clad, at the task of dinner. It was his week to
cook and he thanked God the agony would soon be over.
Cake! He had never been able to make cake with confidence
since the day when he had put in salt instead of
saleratus. The cake had not risen but his fellows had.</p>

<p>&#8220;What you trying to do, Avery?&#8221; Ha Ha had demanded.
&#8220;This might have been made by Lot&#8217;s
wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the living room sat the other members of the crew,
all except Tom Lupton who was forth on the east patrol.
All smoked pipes except the youngest, Joe Sayre, Surfman
No. 7. Joe was eighteen and Cap&#8217;n Smiley suffered
great anxiety lest cigarettes impair the physique
inherited from generations of bay-going ancestors.</p>

<p>All smoked; at the word that dinner was ready all
would cease to smoke and begin to eat. At the conclusion
of dinner they would light up again. All were
hungry, all were hardy. Seven nights before, drenched
to the skin, blinded by rain and hail and braced against
a full gale, they had battled all night to save men from a
ship smashing to pieces on the outer bar. Not one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
them showed a sign of that prolonged and terrible
struggle.</p>

<p>Cap&#8217;n Smiley drew up his chair at one end of the
table, which thus became the head. Mermaid was seated
beside him. For her there was mush and milk, the
latter supplied by the only cow on the beach, which belonged
to Mrs. Biggles. For the others huskier fare:
corned beef and cabbage, hardtack and butter, bread
pudding and coffee. Each waited on himself and on
the others. There must be conversation; Cap&#8217;n Smiley
valued certain amenities as evidence of man&#8217;s civilized
state and table conversation was one of them. It devolved
on him to start it. He said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Has the beach been gone over to-day for wreckage?&#8221;</p>

<p>It appeared it had. Jim Mapes and Joe Sayre, aided
somewhat by Mrs. Biggles&#8217;s husband, had walked east
and west almost to the stations on either side of Lone
Cove. There was much driftwood from the lost ship.
Some tinned provisions had come ashore but seemed
hopelessly spoiled. And one body.</p>

<p>&#8220;Found it well up on the beach about two miles east,&#8221;
Jim Mapes told the keeper. &#8220;That of the captain.
Biggles took it over to Bellogue. I kept the papers he
had on him. Put &#8217;em on your desk, Cap&#8217;n.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look &#8217;em over later,&#8221; the keeper remarked. &#8220;Did
Biggles take off that fo&#8217;c&#8217;s&#8217;le scum?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And a good riddance,&#8221; declared the keeper. &#8220;Evil-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
fellow, if I ever saw one. A squarehead, too.
Some Dutch name or other&mdash;Dirk or Derrick or just
plain Dirt. The owners said to let him go. But the
curious thing is they couldn&#8217;t tell me what I wanted to
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>He glanced at the small girl beside him. She had
finished her supper and sat back in her chair, looking a
little timidly and a little sleepily at the men. Cap&#8217;n
Smiley interrupted his meal to carry her to his room
whence, after an interval, he returned grinning happily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eyes closed as soon as she was in bed,&#8221; he informed
his crew. Then his forehead wrinkled again as he sat
down.</p>

<p>&#8220;The owners,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;say that the captain
was unmarried. The mate had a wife but no children.
The second was a youngster and single. There was no
passenger, not even one signed on as &#8216;medical officer&#8217; or
anything like that. The ship was direct from San
Francisco, 130 days out. The child must have come
aboard before she sailed, but there is no record to show
who she is. Have any of you talked to her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; Ho Ha answered. &#8220;Easy-like, you know,
Cap&#8217;n. She says she hasn&#8217;t any name. The captain
looked after her and she lived in a spare cabin. The
steward she remembers because he was kind to her and
because he was lame. She had never seen any one
aboard before she came on the ship. Doesn&#8217;t know how
she got there. Woke up to find herself in the cabin and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the &#8216;bed rocking.&#8217; Before being on the boat she lived
with &#8216;a tall lady&#8217; whom she called Auntie. Just Auntie,
nothing else. It was in the country, some place near
Frisco, maybe. On shipboard the captain and the
steward called her &#8216;little girl&#8217; when they called her anything.
None of the others spoke to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Most of the men had finished eating. Cap&#8217;n Smiley
got up and went to his desk. He picked up the papers
that had been washed ashore with the body of the
<i>Mermaid&#8217;s</i> skipper. There were certain of the ship&#8217;s
papers, a little memorandum book with no entries, and a
personal letter. The ink had run badly on the soaked
documents and the letter was illegible except for a few
words. These were far apart and decipherable after
much pains.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Only child ... return her ... precautions
... do not want my whereabouts ...
so no message ... forgiveness&#8217;&#8221; puzzled out the
keeper. From hand to hand the letter went to confirm
these conjectural readings. The keeper scratched
his head. His forehead showed little vertical lines.
His blue eyes were thoughtful, and the wrinkles that
converged at their corners, the result of much sea gazing,
showed up like little furrows of light and shadow under
the rays of the big oil lamp hanging overhead. The
sense of so much as he had read was clear enough, but
the story was woefully incomplete. What were a few
words in a couple of sentences of a long letter? Four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
large sheets had been covered by that shaky and rather
small handwriting; and for the fourteen words he could
make out there were at least four hundred lost.</p>

<p>Footfalls sounded on the boardwalk outside the door,
not the steady tramp of Tom Lupton returning from the
easterly stretch of the beach but lighter steps of someone
running. The door opened quickly and Mrs.
Biggles appeared among them, white and breathless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cap&#8217;n,&#8221; she panted. &#8220;There&#8217;s a stranger on the
beach. My Henry hasn&#8217;t got back yet&mdash;he maybe&#8217;ll
be staying over to Bellogue till morning. I heard a
noise at a window and there was a man&#8217;s face. He disappeared
quick. I was so frightened I couldn&#8217;t run and
I couldn&#8217;t stay; so finally I run over here. &#8217;Twasn&#8217;t
any face I ever saw before. It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s a sailor like the
one Henry took off. And&mdash;oh, have mercy on us!&mdash;they&#8217;re
all drowned!&#8221;</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Cap&#8217;n Smiley, young Joe Sayre, and Jim Mapes went
back with Mrs. Biggles. It was a clear night with many
stars but the moon had not yet risen. The fresh, damp
southeast wind was playing great chords upon the organ
of the surf. Eight minutes&#8217; tramping over the dunes
brought the four persons to the Biggles house&mdash;a fisherman&#8217;s
shack of two rooms, but tight and dry. The
lamp&#8217;s glow came through window panes. After
circling the house Cap&#8217;n Smiley moved to one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
windows. He came back immediately and said to the
others with a low chuckle:</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoever he is, he&#8217;s hungry. Mrs. Biggles, he&#8217;s
eating your provender!&#8221;</p>

<p>All fear left the bayman&#8217;s wife. With an exclamation
she advanced before the others could restrain her. They
followed her through the door in time to hear her exclaim:</p>

<p>&#8220;You good-for-nothing, what are you doing eating my
Henry&#8217;s cold samp porridge!&#8221;</p>

<p>The man choked on a mouthful. Swiftly he rose
and tried to slip by her. She gave him a heavy box
on the head and the men at the door caught and held
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you? What are you doing here?&#8221; asked
Cap&#8217;n Smiley, sharply, though amazed mirth at the
transformation of Mrs. Biggles caused his eyes to
twinkle. The sailor stood quietly enough. His English
was poor. He was, he said, one of the crew of the
wrecked ship. He had been washed ashore unconscious
on the night of the disaster but had recovered his senses
before dawn, creeping into the sandhills. There he had
hidden in bushes and slept. He had slept all day and at
night he had prowled about. Breaking into one of the
few summer cottages on the beach he had found a little
food and on that he had subsisted. He hadn&#8217;t approached
the Coast Guard Station nor made himself
known to any one because of a fight in San Francisco in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
which he had killed a man. A boarding-house keeper
had sheltered him and put him on the <i>Mermaid</i>, but the
captain knew who he was and he had expected to be
arrested when the ship made New York. The wreck
had seemed to offer him a miraculous chance of escape,
and he had somehow escaped with his life. Was he to
survive in the face of such odds only to lose his life
ashore? But now, half-starved and plainly feverish, he
could struggle no longer; he would confess and take his
chances. His eye remained with a fixed fascination on
the food that lay on the table. He wriggled feebly in
Cap&#8217;n Smiley&#8217;s hard grasp to reach it; then sank down
limply with delirious mutterings.</p>

<p>The keeper and Joe Sayre picked him up and carried
him, as men on shipboard carry a lighter sail, to the station.
Mrs. Biggles, entirely reassured, they left in her
cabin. At the station a bed was made on the floor in the
living room, not far from the stove. The keeper got out
his medicine chest and prepared to spend a wakeful night.</p>

<p>The man was evidently in a very bad state. Sedatives
seemed to have no effect on him. He tossed about on
the floor as if he felt a heaving deck under him. He
talked almost continuously. His exchanges with the
boarding-house keeper and with the skipper of the
<i>Mermaid</i> were on his lips; and interspersed with cringing
entreaties were sentences that must have been uttered
in a quarrel with the man he had killed. Cap&#8217;n Smiley
listened patiently, but he could not make much of it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>The man killed in the fight had not been a sailor but
a landsman, that was evident, and he had had something
to do with a woman&mdash;no, a girl. Then came the words,
&#8220;Six years old,&#8221; and the keeper suddenly realized that
all this might relate to the child sleeping in his bed. He
bent down and waited for her name, but it never came.
Most likely the speaker did not know it. There was
something about a &#8220;Captain King,&#8221; but the name of the
<i>Mermaid&#8217;s</i> captain had been Jackson.... This
Captain King had had something to do with the six-year-old
girl.... She was not his child but
another&#8217;s.... He had arranged to send her
back ... keeping himself out of it....
Child ... Cap&#8217;n Smiley&#8217;s thoughts travelled to
the letter found with the body of the <i>Mermaid&#8217;s</i> skipper.
It must have been from this Captain King. But to
whom was he returning this child who was not his? And
who were her parents? All this sick man knew he had
learned from an agent of Captain King who had
brought the child to the master of the <i>Mermaid</i>, and who
had been drinking with the money someone, presumably
King, had paid him.... The keeper, with a beating
heart, gave heed to the sailor&#8217;s talking. Much of it
was irrelevant and not a little was unclean; once the man
sang part of a chantey, and once he cursed a fellow working
beside him aloft on a yard. It was a long and
strained vigil that the Coast Guardsman kept, and when,
toward morning, the poor wretch on the floor sank into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
a coma and died, he had an intolerable sense of being
cheated, first by a dead man who should have kept his
papers in oilskin packets, and then by a dying man
whose tongue should either have wagged a few hours
longer or never have wagged at all.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>Spring advanced. The velvety grass of the salt meadows
became a delightful green. Mermaid of the Lone
Cove Station played all day among the dunes and down
by the surf, and the men, particularly Ho Ha, played
with her. She had a part in their daily drills and exercises.
When they wigwagged with red and white flags
she wigwagged with a small red and white flag, too.
When the little brass cannon was fired and Jim Mapes,
standing on a platform that encircled a high pole&mdash;a
platform that represented the maintop as the pole represented
a ship&#8217;s mainmast&mdash;caught the heaving line and
made it fast Mermaid, her hair glinting in the sunlight,
stood beside him. The line rigged, Mermaid made the
round trip to the dunes and back, and then a last trip to
the dunes in the breeches buoy. Her two small legs protruded
ridiculously, and the tip of her head was hidden in
the big circle of the buoy&#8217;s belt. On other days there was
drill with the surf boat, but on these occasions Mermaid
could only stand on the beach and jump up and down
with excitement while her uncles (as she was taught to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
call them) waded warily out in big hip boots, watched
for the right moment, and pushed beyond the breakers.
Cap&#8217;n Smiley, who was always helping the little girl
to invent games, had suggested to her that she play
she was on a desert island. He had explained to her
what a desert island was, and had made her acquainted,
verbally, with one Robinson Crusoe.</p>

<p>She, Mermaid, was a desert islander and the surfboat,
returning, was a boat come to take her off. She
had been alone, utterly alone, on the desert island for
years. At the sight of the boat coming through the
surf emotion should be hers. It was, and would have
been anyway; but it might never have been the imaginative
and kindled thing it became with the keeper&#8217;s
help. Standing at the tiller he would call out, as the
boat turned shoreward:</p>

<p>&#8220;Courage! You shall be restored to your family
and friends!&#8221;</p>

<p>And when the boat was beached he would advance
to the child, bow respectfully before her, and even
sometimes, kneeling, kiss her hand. He would say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Your gracious Majesty, we have voyaged to the
Indies and have taken possession of them in the name
of Castile!&#8221;</p>

<p>Or:</p>

<p>&#8220;Welcome, my lady, back to the world of living men!&#8221;</p>

<p>Or, merely bowing, and with a deference as studied
as Stanley&#8217;s in the African jungle:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>&#8220;Madame Mermaid, I believe!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mermaid received him without full comprehension
but with high glee. With a deplorable lack of etiquette
she invariably reached up both arms, put them around
his lowered neck, and kissed him.</p>

<p>She was pretty with the promise of loveliness, perhaps
of beauty. It was not only her hair and her eyes
but the modelling of her chin and the spacing of her
features. The skin was unusually clear, with colour
in the cheeks, and a few faint, clustered freckles.</p>

<p>The men were devoted to her and she returned their
affection. Even Ha Ha, the sad soul, the introspective
one, though he never smiled, was less gloomy in his
opinions when Mermaid stood by. Ho Ha, unable to
compete with the keeper in telling engrossing stories,
set himself to work to provide pets. There were foxes
on the beach and he had come upon a litter. The cubs
were dedicated to Mermaid&mdash;until nightfall when their
mother gnawed the ropes which fastened them. Ho
Ha sought vainly in Bellogue and Blue Port for a white
rabbit with pink eyes. The beach was infested with
plain brown rabbits, for the most part rather unafraid
of man. Mermaid could approach within a few feet of
these but they would not stay to let her touch them.
Occasionally, trotting along the ocean shore beside Ho
Ha, Mermaid came upon the round-toed tracks of a
cat. Then the coast guardsman would explain how
some of the summer people had left their cats on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
beach in the fall to fend for themselves. Cats so
abandoned, explained Ho Ha, quickly became wild;
they doubtless caught birds and visited the water&#8217;s
edge in the reasonable hope of finding a bit of fish for
supper. They were as wild as the foxes and much
more savage; if Mermaid should see one she must not
make advances lest she be set upon and clawed. The
sinuous line in the sand was the trail of a snake, probably
a harmless garter snake, but possibly a black
snake. Mermaid shuddered and her little hand closed
more firmly over Ho Ha&#8217;s fingers.</p>

<p>While her natural education was thus proceeding
Cap&#8217;n Smiley gave much thought to the question of
her schooling. Soon she would be seven, if, indeed,
she were not already. Since the lack of a birthday
is troublesome he bestowed his own upon her and
promised some sort of a birthday party come May
27th.</p>

<p>But before this celebration ripened the agreeable
course of life on the beach suffered an intrusion. On a
fine May day Cap&#8217;n Smiley was puzzled to see advancing
along the beach and turning in toward his
station a group of women whom he recognized, as they
neared, to be from Blue Port. Hastily assuring himself
that his sister was not one, he arrested the drill
with the breaches buoy and stepped forward to meet
them. There were Mrs. Horton, Mrs. Brand, Mrs.
Dayton, and Miss Errily. The four came up slowly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
talking among themselves with earnestness. When
they were within earshot they stopped and Miss Errily
seemed to take the lead, her thin lips closed in a
straight line.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning,&#8221; said Cap&#8217;n Smiley, pleasantly.
&#8220;We&#8217;re about finished with the drill, but there&#8217;s time
enough to see it done over if&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Errily interrupted him:</p>

<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t come to see the drill, Cap&#8217;n Smiley,&#8221; she
said in the severe tone natural to her. &#8220;We came to
protest, on behalf of good people, against your allowing
that child with the improper name to stay here. No
one knows anything about her and I dare say the name
you&#8217;ve given her is no worse than the rest if it were
known; but a crew of rough men is not a fit surrounding
in which any child should be brought up.&#8221;</p>

<p>For an ex-schoolteacher Miss Errily&#8217;s sentence construction
was not flattering, but it was not the construction
which bothered the keeper. The pleasant
expression left his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like insinuations, Miss Errily. Say what
you have to say right out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Errily compressed her lips more tightly before
reopening them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everyone knows, Cap&#8217;n Smiley, that this girl is a
nobody-knows-who.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; the keeper told her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doubtless,&#8221; pursued Miss Errily, &#8220;she is a&mdash;no, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
cannot bring myself to say it, and it is unnecessary&mdash;an
Improper Child&#8221; (Miss Errily&#8217;s tone capitalized the
words) &#8220;With Improper Origins and Antecedents.
Her proper place is an Institution. Naturally, the
Children&#8217;s Home connected with the county house and
poor farm. They train them very well for domestic
service, and good servants are becoming scarce. Few
nowadays can keep their place and so, few keep their
places. Besides, it is a Scandal&mdash;I speak frankly&mdash;an
Open Scandal for a child of her years to be living here
with rough men who cannot look after her properly nor
discipline her. School, church, and home; she goes
without all three.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cap&#8217;n Smiley&#8217;s blue eyes flashed as the blue ocean
at which he had been gazing flashed when the sun
caught the waves. Now he turned and faced the
women, but Ho Ha, who had been listening with
clenched fists, was before him. At the beginning of
Miss Errily&#8217;s remarks Ho Ha had whispered in Mermaid&#8217;s
ear and the child had scampered toward the
station, not unpleased, for she did not like the looks the
visitors gave her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a minute, Miss Errily,&#8221; said Ho Ha. He
drawled the words. &#8220;Wait&mdash;a&mdash;minute. You are
not holding school, now. Who sent you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The spokeswoman stiffened. She replied, angrily:</p>

<p>&#8220;We represent the Feeling of a Community. We&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And this,&#8221; observed Ho Ha, not waiting for her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
&#8220;is another community. If you represent any feelings
except your own and those of a few other meddlesome
women, Miss Errily, it&#8217;s the first time in forty years&mdash;you&#8217;re
about sixty-two, aren&#8217;t you? My father was
in your first class and you were about twenty-two
then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hosea!&#8221; said the keeper, in a low tone of rebuke,
but he shook oddly as he said it.</p>

<p>&#8220;My age,&#8221; quivered Miss Errily, &#8220;whatever it is,
should be sufficient to insure Respectful Treatment.&#8221;
But she was obviously upset. Mrs. Brand took her
place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Insult me, if you dare, Hosea Hand!&#8221; she cried,
challengingly. Ho Ha looked at her thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t tell any one to his face what you write
about people to other people, Maria Brand,&#8221; he rejoined.
&#8220;I still have your letter in which you wrote me
that Cap&#8217;n Smiley&#8217;s sister&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never wrote such a letter!&#8221; almost shrieked
Maria Brand, with a look of half terror at the keeper,
whose eye, fixed on the glittering ocean, remained there.
Ho Ha, turning to Mrs. Dayton as if he were finishing
a sentence addressed to her, went on implacably.</p>

<p>&#8220;&mdash;if you must look after other people&#8217;s children,
why not look after your husband&#8217;s?&#8221; Mrs. Dayton
went red and white, half opened her lips, and then
started to walk rapidly away. The ranks had broken.
Miss Errily and Maria Brand, followed by Mrs. Horton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
were also in rapid retreat in the direction taken by
Amelia Dayton who had no children, and whose husband&#8217;s
did not bear the name of Dayton. Cap&#8217;n Smiley
frowned on his surfman. &#8220;That was going too far!&#8221;
he censured him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit, not a bit!&#8221; said Ho Ha with heat. &#8220;Nothing
but a pack of busybodies! Dick Dayton&#8217;s brats
roll in dirt while Amelia Dayton lends money at usury.
My regret is that I didn&#8217;t get a chance to ask Jane
Horton if she had paid her farmer&#8217;s fine yet. You know
he watered the milk and I can guess by whose orders!&#8221;</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>For the birthday party they had Mrs. Biggles and her
Henry as guests, and a great cake made by Ho Ha from a
recipe supplied by Mrs. Biggles. It carried seven candles&mdash;one
for each of Mermaid&#8217;s years and one, the same
ones, to be sure, for each of her seven uncles. Dad, as
Cap&#8217;n Smiley desired her to call him, blew them all out
with one vasty breath, whereat Mrs. Biggles cried out
that this was Mermaid&#8217;s privilege. But the little girl
could not extinguish her seven candles all at once any
more than she could kiss her seven uncles collectively, so
she gave individual attention to each candle and each
uncle. Mrs. Biggles must have a kiss, too, and returned
it several times over; and became so excited that she
kissed her Henry in his and the public eye, but then, as
she observed, his whiskers left her hardly any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
region and her surroundings left her hardly any other
choice. There was much jesting and even a drinking
of healths in some cider Mrs. Biggles&#8217;s Henry had contributed,
the chief toast being Cap&#8217;n Smiley&#8217;s &#8220;to my
seven surfmen and one surfwoman&#8221; with a pinch of
Mermaid&#8217;s soft pink cheek.</p>

<p>Spring swept into summer; the green meadows were
set off by great blooms of pink marsh mallow; the sun,
shining down vertically on the white sand of the beach,
caused a brilliant glare that changed, at the horizons,
to a blue haze of heat. White-sailed boats moved over
the five-mile width of Great South Bay, taking to and
fro men in white trousers and gaily-clad women and
children who might wish to spend a day at the tavern
to the westward of the station, a place of ragtime
music, clicking billiard balls, &#8220;shore&#8221; dinners, and
home-prepared lunches. The clean sand was daily
littered with empty shoeboxes and crumpled paper
napkins by these family groups who picnicked between
dips in the surf. Except for a few inevitable &#8220;fine
swimmers&#8221; they clung, laughing and shrieking, to a
line of rope tethered to a barrel just beyond the break
of the waves.</p>

<p>With the children of these beach parties Mermaid
could play the day long and sometimes did; many of the
visitors were summer residents of the south shore of
Long Island, but not many of them had heard the
little girl&#8217;s story; if they gave her any thought they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
accepted her as a child of one of the Coast Guardsmen.
Strollers who came to the station to look at the
apparatus of life saving&mdash;the breeches buoy, the life
car which travelled to and from a distressed ship and the
shore, the surf boat resting on its truck, and ready to
be hauled laboriously through a mile or more of sand,
the gun&mdash;these people would see Mermaid, but never
think to ask her history. Why should they, indeed,
even suppose she had one? And in telling of wrecks
along the beach Cap&#8217;n Smiley generally omitted any
mention of one; if he was asked about the time the
<i>Mermaid</i> came ashore he would answer quite willingly,
but a specific question was necessary to elicit the most
romantic and still mysterious part of that story.</p>

<p>The keeper had many other tales unusual enough to
satisfy the craving of the casual caller for a picturesque
yarn. Out of his thirty years at the station he
could supply episodes ranging from the ridiculous to
the horrible, and many rehearsals, joined to some
natural gift as a narrator, enabled him to tell his
stories well. In pleasant summer weather, however,
they lost much of their possible effectiveness; to
appraise them at their true worth you had to hear
them in winter, sitting and smoking or dreaming by
the blazing stove in the station&#8217;s long living room,
a lamp swinging overhead, the wind shaking the
building while the sound of the not-distant surf came
in to you as a thunderous and unbroken roar. On a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
summer&#8217;s night with all the stars shining, the wind
whispering and bringing coolness from the leagues of
ocean, the surf merely murmuring and&mdash;yes, the
mosquitoes biting moderately&mdash;on such a night you
could form no just conception of the setting in which
these tales belonged.</p>

<p>With fall, came the question of Mermaid and school.
After a severe mental struggle Cap&#8217;n Smiley decided
that this could go over for a year. He could teach the
child her letters; as a matter of fact, she already knew
most of them from the weekly practice at wigwagging
with the red and white flags. The keeper knew of no one
on &#8220;the mainland&#8221; to whom he felt willing to entrust
the child; he was inclined to consider his sister out of
the question; in another year some satisfactory arrangement
might present itself. Besides, both he and
the men, but he himself particularly, would be loath
to part with Mermaid. She was a big thing in their
lives, and in Cap&#8217;n Smiley&#8217;s the biggest. Mrs.
Biggles had said lately that she and her Henry were
getting along; they contemplated giving up life on the
beach except for a short while in summer. They
would take a house in Blue Port and live there ten
months out of the twelve. Should they do this Mermaid
would have a good home while she was getting
her schooling; Cap&#8217;n Smiley and the crew would miss
her sorely, but their minds would be easy, and every
one of them on his twenty-four hours&#8217; leave could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
look in on her and see how she was.... When
the time should be ripe to carry this general scheme
into execution it was Cap&#8217;n Smiley&#8217;s intention legally
to adopt Mermaid, although, as he said to himself,
Mermaid Smiley would <i>not</i> do as a name. It had altogether
too strong a flavour of the portraits on certain
pages of the Sunday newspapers. He would adopt
her as Mary Smiley ... though in all likelihood
she would always be called Mermaid. The name
well befitted her, dancing about down there on the
beach and slipping in and out of the water in the bathing
suit Mrs. Biggles had made for her from some old
dress of pale green with silver edgings. Musing over
the name Cap&#8217;n Smiley burst into such laughter that
Ha Ha the Gloomy, peeling potatoes in the kitchen,
gave a start and cut his finger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just thinking of Henry Biggles&#8217;s father,&#8221; the
keeper explained. &#8220;&#8217;Member him? Lived here on
the beach. Eighteen children. Old Jacob Biggles
hadn&#8217;t much education; in fact, he couldn&#8217;t read and
write. Named most of the children after vessels that
came ashore on the beach. One was Monarch Biggles&mdash;you&#8217;ve
heard of Mon Biggles?&mdash;and another was
Siamese Prince Biggles&mdash;that&#8217;s Si Biggles. Then
along came a lot of boys and a lot of wrecks named the
<i>Queen</i>, the <i>Merry Maid</i>, and other unsuitable things.
Poor Jacob was in despair. Some of the boys had to
wait eight years to get a handle.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>&#8220;He could have got names out of the Bible,&#8221; Ha Ha
pointed out.</p>

<p>&#8220;He could get &#8217;em but he couldn&#8217;t pronounce &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>In September Mermaid and Cap&#8217;n Smiley and Ho Ha
went beach-plumming. As they wandered over the
dunes picking the blue-red-purple berries there was
much conversation, sometimes conducted in shouts,
when the three were spread a little apart.</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217; you know the Latin name of these plums,
Hosea?&#8221; demanded the keeper. Ho Ha looked very
serious.</p>

<p>&#8220;My bad mark in school was always in Latin!&#8221;</p>

<p>The keeper winked at Mermaid. Ho Ha had gone to
a little red schoolhouse, winters, until he was thirteen.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s <i>prunus maritima</i>,&#8221; he reminded the scholar.
&#8220;That&#8217;s almost calling &#8217;em maritime prunes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re commoner than prunes with us. Do they
get the name from being served in sailors&#8217; boarding-houses?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were shanghaied to sea, once, weren&#8217;t you,
Hosea?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sixteen when it happened. On South Street, New
York. Froze my feet standing a trick at the wheel off
Cape Horn. Mate came into the fo&#8217;c&#8217;s&#8217;le and grabbed
one foot and twisted it until I howled; then he pulled
me out on deck,&#8221; said the Coast Guard, reminiscently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
&#8220;I&#8217;d always been sort of crazy about the sea from a kid.&#8221;
He emptied his pickings into a big basket, straightened
up a moment, resumed his picking, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I worshipped, just about, an uncle, my mother&#8217;s
brother, who&#8217;d been to sea all his life. And when I was
a shaver on our farm up in the hills in the middle of the
Island I slept in the attic. Every night, Cap&#8217;n, as I
got in bed I could see through a little attic window,
right over the tree tops Fire Island light. &#8217;Twas maybe
twenty miles away. &#8217;Twould show, just a faint spark,
then kindle, then glow bright, then flame like&mdash;like a
beacon. Just for a few seconds; then &#8217;twould die out.
Occulting. It seemed to beckon to me. I was only a
kid and there was something wonderful and friendly
about that light! And secret, too. It seemed to be
signalling just to me, a little chap in an ice-cold attic on
a lonely hill farm. Seemed as if that light said: &#8216;Come
on, Hosea Hand! I&#8217;m set here to tell you that there&#8217;s
a great world out here waiting for you! I&#8217;m an outpost!
There&#8217;s lands and peoples and adventures and
ten thousand leagues of ocean&mdash;and there&#8217;s life, the
greatest adventure of all! Hurry up and grow up,
Hosea Hand!&#8217; And then all shivering and excited, I&#8217;d
crouch under the big, pieced quilt and watch that light
come and glow, shine and dim, flame and go out&mdash;until
I&#8217;d fall asleep and dream I was out there where it
called me!&#8221;</p>

<p>The little girl listened, fascinated. She had stopped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
picking, and her childish breast rose and fell with quick
breathing. Cap&#8217;n Smiley picked perfunctorily and
once his hand closed so tightly about the coloured plums
that they crushed them. Ho Ha worked steadily and
after a few moments he went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;I was fourteen when my father died. The year
before I&#8217;d quit school to help work the farm. In those
days there wasn&#8217;t any science called agriculture. We
just tilled the soil. My father was always trying to
get more land; I used to wonder what for, when it was
such slavery to work it! Maybe he suspicioned the
day would come when we&#8217;d understand the soil and
know how to make it yield without back-breaking and
heart-break.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your brother is pretty comfortably off, Hosea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Ho Ha, with a curious inflection. &#8220;Yes,
Richard&#8217;s comfortable. But he&#8217;s getting along. You
know he&#8217;s ten years older than me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cap&#8217;n Smiley gave an ejaculation of surprise. There
had been some unfairness of dealing by Richard Hand
with Hosea Hand after their father&#8217;s death, but the
keeper did not know exactly what it was. The Blue
Port story had it that Richard Hand had wanted his
brother to stay and help work the farm, and Ho Ha
had run off to sea instead. Back of this lay a tale of the
father&#8217;s will. This had left the dead man&#8217;s estate to
be divided equally between the sons. Richard, however,
was to have the farm intact; and he was to effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
such a settlement as would assure Hosea of his share in
cash for whatever use he wanted to make of it. The
father&#8217;s idea had been simple: the younger boy hated
the farm and wanted an education; this money would
help him get it; after that he must fend for himself.</p>

<p>So much Cap&#8217;n Smiley knew; so much, indeed, everybody
knew. The rest no one appeared exactly to know,
but the general impression was that Richard, as executor,
had wound up his father&#8217;s affairs to suit himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; Cap&#8217;n Smiley asked himself as
he picked away, giving only absent attention to Mermaid&#8217;s
chatter. &#8220;Knowing Richard Hand as I do, I
suspect Hosea never got a cent of money and never will.
I can make a pretty good guess that after paying the
debts there was nothing left but the farm. To settle
fairly with the boy, Dick Hand would have had to
borrow money by mortgaging the place&mdash;and I don&#8217;t
see him doing that!</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; concluded the keeper to himself. &#8220;Fourteen-year-old
boy with no one to look out to see he got
his rights. No lawyer had a hand in that estate!
Dick delays the settlement; in the meantime, his young
brother gets restless. Dick treats him badly; insists
the boy stay and help work the farm; Hosea runs away.
Dick winds up the estate; represents himself willing to
settle with his brother but unable to; don&#8217;t know his
whereabouts. Ho Ha away for years; when he comes
back he tells his brother to go to the devil!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>Mermaid was conducting a dialogue with the wronged
Hosea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncle Ho!&#8221; she cried, and Cap&#8217;n Smiley was reminded
of the &#8220;Land, ho!&#8221; of the sailor. &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t
that a queer way for David to deal with the Ph&#8217;listines?&#8221;
Mrs. Biggles read the Bible Sunday mornings to her
Henry and Mermaid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; inquired Mermaid, &#8220;do you suppose he
spanked them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who spanked?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;David spanked the Ph&#8217;listines,&#8221; explained Mermaid.
Ho Ha and the keeper eyed each other and then
looked perplexedly at the red-haired mite. &#8220;How do you
know he spanked the Philistines?&#8221; ventured the keeper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it says he smote&mdash;that means struck&mdash;them
&#8216;hip and thigh,&#8217;&#8221; she replied. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be awful glad
when I can read about it myself. David threw a stone
at Gollyath and killed him. Maybe a good spanking
was all Gollyath needed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; assented Cap&#8217;n Smiley. Ho Ha was
speechless. The keeper looked at him. &#8220;See your
uncle, Mermaid,&#8221; he directed. &#8220;Living up to his name,
isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>The child caught the contagion of laughter and
bubbled with it herself. &#8220;Do tell me what&#8217;s so funny,
Uncle Ho,&#8221; she begged. &#8220;Please do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A ghost just told me a joke,&#8221; said Ho Ha, looking at
her with twinkling eyes. Mermaid was alert and excited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
at once. She believed in ghosts, not only because
she was seven years old but because she lived on the
Great South Beach where ghosts are natural and both
respectable and respected. She clamoured to hear the
joke. Ho Ha considered. He did not know as he
ought to tell her; perhaps the ghost would not like that;
it might want to tell Mermaid itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you tell me what ghost it is?&#8221; the youngster
besought him. &#8220;Was it the Duneswoman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Ho Ha answered. &#8220;It was one of the pirates.
One of Kidd&#8217;s men. One of those fellows with gold
earrings and black whiskers. Well&mdash;I don&#8217;t know&#8217;s
there&#8217;s any harm in my telling you. He said if Kidd
had been spanked proper as a boy&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Ho Ha
stopped, as if no more need be said, and shook his head
with a regretful air. Mermaid remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose, Uncle Ho, that Mrs. Biggles spanks
Mr. Biggles?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt she has to sometimes,&#8221; agreed Ho Ha,
with perfect seriousness.</p>

<p>Mermaid emptied her apron of a pint of plums.
Her mind slipped back to ghosts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad,&#8221; she asked Cap&#8217;n Smiley, &#8220;does the Duneswoman
know everything about the beach?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think she does, pretty nearly,&#8221; the keeper told her.
&#8220;Do you see much of her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only her head and arms. Sometimes she reaches out
her arm to me.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>&#8220;I meant, do you see her often?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes! Except when I&#8217;m with Mrs. Biggles.
Mrs. Biggles says she never has seen her. She says I
ought not to see her and mustn&#8217;t pay any &#8217;tention to
her,&#8221; Mermaid informed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps that&#8217;s because Mrs. Biggles never sees her
and doesn&#8217;t know how nice she is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what <i>I</i> said.&#8221; Mermaid bit a plum and made
a wry face. She wanted to ask Dad more about the
Duneswoman.</p>

<p>That was a ghost only he and she had seen&mdash;a lovely
Face and Arm that sometimes floated for an instant on
the dark summer ocean, looked toward you ...
and was gone.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>A golden October when, for days, the sun shone
and the beach was veiled with faintly coloured mists;
when the crack of duck hunters&#8217; guns came from over
the bay; when the ocean advanced on the smoothly
sanded shore in long and majestic curves, so that to
stand upon the dunes and look at it was like looking
down a flight of steps of boundless width....
The Atlantic made itself into a glittering staircase
leading straight to the sun.</p>

<p>October! Driftwood was gathered from the beach for
burning in the Biggles&#8217;s fireplace where it snapped and
was consumed by the green and blue and parti-coloured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
flames. Before the singing and rainbow fire Mermaid
often knelt at dusk. Mrs. Biggles would spread a slice
of bread for her with jelly made from the beach plums
gathered a month earlier. There is a wild-woodish,
bitter-sweet flavour peculiar to beach plum jelly and
preserves. Mermaid loved it. To taste it while dreaming
before the magic fire was delicious beyond words.</p>

<p>October! It began to be sharp o&#8217; nights. The men
at the station rolled themselves in blankets, as they
slept without sheets in an unheated attic. Only Mermaid
had a regular bed with sheets and pillow cases and
a gay comforter. Stormy days began, and long, wonderful
evenings about the blazing stove in the station&#8217;s
big room. Cap&#8217;n Smiley read aloud and told stories;
the men asked questions and spun yarns. Mermaid,
curled up in a corner, listened eagerly, hardly daring to
speak lest the hour be noted and they pack her off to bed.</p>

<p>Wild stories, weird stories. Cap&#8217;n Smiley is speaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; says the keeper. &#8220;There was that steamship
which broke her machinery some way off here and could
only move on reversed propellers. She backed all the
way from here to Sandy Hook. And there was that
ship with the cargo of salt. When she came ashore it
salted the ocean; the water was a little brinier for
days. And we got aboard as she lay on the bar at low
tide, the sea having gone down. Not a soul. All swept
overboard and lost. We peered down a hatch, then
I went down all alone. I had an awful setback when,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
on my moving some sacks, out bobbed a dead man
staring straight at me. Dead, and propped up in the
salt. But the worst was the wreck of the <i>Farallone</i>.
Some of you weren&#8217;t here then and as for you, Joe&#8221;&mdash;he
addressed the youngest surfman&mdash;&#8220;you hadn&#8217;t
been born. The <i>Farallone</i>. Yes.</p>

<p>&#8220;She came ashore on a night when you couldn&#8217;t see
your upraised hand. She struck hard on the outer bar
and broached to in the trough of the sea. It was
freezing cold. We saw&mdash;nothing. Up there on the
dunes we fired shot after shot, sending out line after line;
pure guesswork. Finally one landed and was made
fast. The crew began coming ashore. About a dozen
trips of the buoy, I think. And from what we could
learn the captain and the cook were left.</p>

<p>&#8220;The cook came along all right, and then we hauled
the buoy back for the skipper.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the signal&mdash;jerks on the line&mdash;we pulled. The
buoy came along for maybe fifteen feet and then
checked. Dead stop. We couldn&#8217;t budge it a foot
farther. We hauled back and tried over again. Came
just so far and then stuck, immovable.</p>

<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t see, you couldn&#8217;t hear. There was
nothing to do but to haul back and forward, back and
forward about a hundred times. We wore ourselves all
out, though probably the work was all that kept us from
freezing to death. Some of us had frostbites. After a
while a faint light appeared. Dawn, frightened by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
that merciless gale. Dawn, and then daylight; and at
last we could see. The ocean went down; wind had
gone down in the night. What we saw was the body
of the captain of the <i>Farallone</i> hanging stiffly in the
buoy.</p>

<p>&#8220;The line had been made fast to the mast too near the
deck. As we hauled away each man, coming to the
ship&#8217;s bulwark, had to lift his body over it. The last
man had been able to get into the buoy, but in the
minute or two before he reached the bulwark he had
frozen helpless; and when he came to it he couldn&#8217;t
lift himself over.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a silence in which men drew on their pipes.
The hand of young Joe Sayre, Surfman No. 7, rolling a
cigarette, shook slightly. Mermaid saw the scene.
She burned to ask her Dad if he, or any of the others,
had seen the Duneswoman that night in the fearful
storm. Had she walked abroad on the waters, passing
unharmed through the great breakers of inky-black
water with invisible crests of white and curling foam?
Her face&mdash;did no one see it beside the staring form of the
dying skipper? Did none see her arm about him?
Why had she not lifted him over the rail? See....
Dad had said no one could see anything. But you
could <i>always</i>: see the Duneswoman when she was about,
however black the night. Who was she? The little
girl lost herself in a timid reverie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lemons,&#8221; Uncle Ho was saying. &#8220;Oranges,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
onions&mdash;fine big Spanish onions from Valencia; pineapples
and pomegranates, even Havana see-gars but
mostly spoiled by salt water. Once, army blankets;
we slept warm that winter. Cocoanuts every little
while. The next cocoanut I find I&#8217;ll carve a mask out
of for Mermaid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her cheeks flushed and she tossed her hair and
looked at him with dancing eyes. Wasn&#8217;t Uncle Ho
good! And he was wonderfully skillful with a knife; a
full rigged ship carved in a great glass bottle lay in the
keeper&#8217;s room to witness his craftsmanship. He did
marvellous things with bits of rope. He had promised
to make her a hammock and with some fine white rope
he was braiding a mat to adorn the little shelf which
was her dressing table. Rose knots, diamond knots;
knots and hitches and splices without number&mdash;Uncle
Ho was master of them all. Mermaid listened to his
further talk about the things that ships jettison and the
things that wash ashore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even little girls come ashore,&#8221; said Uncle Ho with
great seriousness and nodding his head many times.
&#8220;Not to speak of animals. We brought a Shetland
pony to land in the breeches buoy and, Mermaid, you
should have heard him squeal!&#8221; Mermaid gave a
little squeal of her own. &#8220;Not like that,&#8221; corrected
Ho Ha. &#8220;He said, &#8216;Nay-ay-ay. Nay-yay-yay-yay!&#8217;
That means &#8216;No!&#8217; Why, a Dutch ship, named the
Dutch for good luck, had a cow in the afterhold to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
provide the skipper with fresh milk every morning.
And lots of ships have pigs aboard &#8217;em. Sheep, too.
You might get wool enough for a new suit of homespun.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the strangest thing was the animal ship. Mind
I don&#8217;t say it <i>was</i> Noah&#8217;s Ark, Mermaid. The skipper
was a youngish man, not old enough to be Noah. Maybe
one of his sons. Now this Ark of Noah &amp; Sons came
ashore in fine weather, but very thick. So much fog
young Noah couldn&#8217;t tell where he was. He couldn&#8217;t
shoot the sun at noon. Well&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;He had pairs of almost all kinds of animals aboard.
They were a consignment to the big Zoo in New York.
There was a pair of camels and a pair of leopards and a
pair of lions and pairs of snakes and two beautiful
giraffes with necks so long that they could see as well as
a man in the topgallant rigging. The Ark came on in
fine weather but it didn&#8217;t stay fine. Bad southeasterly
storm blew up and when it abated the Ark was so leaky
that the skipper&mdash;young Noah&mdash;put the animals over
the side thinking they&#8217;d drown. He hated to do it, but
the ship was all going to pieces. But you know, Mermaid,
that all animals can swim. And most of these
critters swam ashore. Little girl, you should have seen
them! But, no! I&#8217;m glad you weren&#8217;t here. Life
wasn&#8217;t safe on the beach here then with those pairs of
animals ranging about. Finally we had to shoot them
all with the little brass cannon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mermaid had been listening, at first doubtfully and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
with enchanted pleasure; but now something about the
story itself joined to some oddity of expression in the
faces of her other uncles caused her to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncle Ho, that isn&#8217;t so, is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so, but so-so,&#8221; replied Ho Ha, persuasively.
&#8220;If you mean, is it true, why&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t mind it&#8217;s not being true,&#8221; explained the
little girl, twisting her fingers. &#8220;It spoils things to
have them true&mdash;just a little&mdash;doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The smile left Ho Ha&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;By gracious! I believe that&#8217;s a fact!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>Keturah Smiley stopped digging potatoes and
walked briskly back to her house. She washed her
hands, but did not change her shabby old man&#8217;s coat.
Keturah&#8217;s everyday attire was preponderantly masculine.
She refrained, however, from wearing trousers.
But a man&#8217;s soft hat was generally pinned to her head,
a man&#8217;s coat was usually on her back, and her low-heeled,
heavy-soled walking shoes were number eights.</p>

<p>She dried her hands, put them in the coat pockets and
started up the lane to the centre of the village. On the
way she met Sim Jenkins, and told him sharply that if
he didn&#8217;t pay the interest on his mortgage more
promptly she would demand the principal. Sim
looked frightened. He knew that Keturah would not
hesitate to foreclose.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>At the principal street intersection of Blue Port
stood the postoffice and the few clustered shops. There
was one two-story structure which constituted Blue
Port&#8217;s only office building. On the ground floor were
a real estate agent, a milliner, and a store where cigars
and soft drinks, magazines and writing paper could be
bought. Up the flight of stairs were a doctor&#8217;s office
and the places of business of Blue Port&#8217;s lawyers.
Blue Port had one saloon, two churches, and three lawyers,
one of whom was a justice of the peace. To this
functionary, Judge Hollaby, Miss Smiley made her
way.</p>

<p>The Judge was sitting in his office with his feet on the
desk and his hat on his head, reading Seneca on old age.
He had not enjoyed a plate of oysters the evening before
with his usual relish, and this had profoundly
depressed him. He was therefore reading; Judge
Hollaby found in reading the consolation that some
men find in drink, although he was by no means a
teetotaler.</p>

<p>Miss Smiley opened the door without knocking. As she
entered rapidly Judge Hollaby put down his feet with an
almost youthful spryness, and hastily removed his hat.
His visitor, to his pain, picked up the half-smoked
cigar that lay extinguished on a corner of his desk and
threw it in the cuspidor. The name of it was La
Coloratura and it had cost 13 cents straight.</p>

<p>Judge Hollaby knew better than to waste breath in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
formal greetings. Keturah Smiley seated herself and
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t beat around the bush but tell me in words I
understand just the disposition of the property my
aunt left me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lawyer felt momentarily flurried. He really had
forgotten the provisions of old Keturah Hawkins&#8217;s will.
However, it would not do to say so&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t do at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Entailed, Miss Smiley, entailed,&#8221; he said with what
he intended to be a retrospective and thoughtful air.
To his client it seemed merely absent-minded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please put your mind on this, Judge Hollaby!&#8221;
she commanded in a tone that reminded the lawyer of
several schoolma&#8217;ams rolled into one. &#8220;I ask you to
use plain words and you start off by using a word like
&#8216;entailed&#8217;! Explain yourself. What is entail?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Judge was very uncomfortable. He made the
absurd mistake of trying to impress his visitor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Under entail,&#8221; he began to explain, &#8220;an estate is
so bequeathed that the inheritors cannot bequeath it at
their pleasure; the fee is abridged and curtailed&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>An impatient sound escaped Miss Smiley.</p>

<p>&#8220;Curtail, if you please,&#8221; she said, &#8220;your fine-sounding
description. As I understand the matter, my
aunt left me all her property in and for my lifetime. I
am to have the free use of it. I can throw it all in the
bay if I like&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Except the real estate,&#8221; interjected the Judge.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>&#8220;I daresay I could dam Hawkins creek and flood
that,&#8221; retorted Keturah, then went on: &#8220;I can use
every cent of it, spend it, waste it; and if there is
nothing left, no one will inherit it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally not,&#8221; assented Judge Hollaby.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unnaturally,&#8221; said his client, sharply. &#8220;It would
be an unnatural thing to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly it would,&#8221; said her lawyer, nervously.
&#8220;Not the least in your character.&#8221; Some misfortune
of accent caught the lady&#8217;s ear and she rounded on him
quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>is</i> my character, Judge Hollaby?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the oysters, perhaps it was Seneca on
old age, perhaps it was a sign of old age itself; at any
rate, the justice&#8217;s mind could not leap gracefully into
the breach thus torn in his defences.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your character, Miss Smiley?&#8221; He tried to express
a sense of shock by his intonation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not loved, I suspect,&#8221; Miss Smiley said, ignoring
his palpable distress. &#8220;I think it very likely there
are those who hate me. But if I am not respected in the
community it is time I knew it. I am honest and I deal
uprightly. I don&#8217;t write slanderous letters, like Maria
Brand; I don&#8217;t cheat, like Jane Horton; I don&#8217;t try to
improve everybody like that uncommon nuisance of an
Errily woman. Nor do I countenance a disgraceful
husband, as Amelia Dayton does. You will say that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
talk like a Pharisee, &#8216;holier than thou&#8217; and so forth.
Judge Hollaby, if there were more Pharisees it would be
a better world! A precious lot of men and women can
only walk straight when it&#8217;s to outshine their neighbours
who are walking crooked!&#8221;</p>

<p>Gradually recovering, the lawyer heard Miss Smiley
saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not here to preach a sermon, but to get information
and some advice. The advice I may take and I
may not; the information I&#8217;ll certainly take if I can get
it out of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She reverted to Keturah Hawkins&#8217;s will. &#8220;I can do as
I please absolutely with the property?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unquestionably. But whatever you leave goes to
your brother, if he survives you, and to his children, if
he has any, in the event he predeceases you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Predeceases!&#8221; snorted Miss Smiley, thrusting her
hands in her pockets. &#8220;What a word! That applies
only to the property my aunt left?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And only to so much of that as I leave?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you call it entail?&#8221;</p>

<p>The lawyer&#8217;s heart sank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Under our laws,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;the bequest could
go no farther. The old English law of entail is broken
here. You can doubly devise but you cannot do more.
The law says that the dead hand shall not&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>Keturah reflected, her severe eyes looking at and
through the man. She could question him freely
whether he saw the drift of her questions or not. She
had a moderate contempt for Horace Hollaby, as she
had for most men, a contempt based on her dealings
with them in which she invariably came out best. The
justice had one virtue, however, that Keturah considered
rare in males. There were things he heard,
things he knew, and things he guessed, about which
he never talked. On certain matters she had never
been able to bully a word out of him. And whatever
she told him would be kept in the back of his
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;My brother,&#8221; she said, her face almost expressionless,
&#8220;has, or had, a wife and child. Are they presumed
to be legally dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>Judge Hollaby told her they were not.</p>

<p>&#8220;In any case, my sister-in-law could not come into any
of the property?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could an adopted child of my brother inherit the
property?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say not; I should want to look at the exact
wording of your aunt&#8217;s will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Miss Smiley, rising with abruptness.
&#8220;For if my brother ever adopts a child I shall
give away or throw away every cent of that money!&#8221;
She moved with decision toward the door. With her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
hand on the knob she turned and said brutally: &#8220;Keep
your mouth shut!&#8221;</p>

<p>The door came to after her with a business-like bang.</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>In winter the Great South Bay is sometimes frozen
over, and then it can be crossed very swiftly on a
scooter, a better vehicle than the Hudson River iceboat
because it will go from ice into water and back again on
to ice without a spill. It is also more easily handled and
travels faster. But there are days and sometimes weeks
when the bay is impassable even for a scooter, which is
merely a tiny boat with a pair of runners, after all.
Thaw and freeze, freeze and thaw; a bay full of big,
floating masses of ice, or so ridged and hillocked that
nothing but an airplane will take you over it. And
there were no airplanes when Mermaid, all wrapped and
mittened, looked out upon the bay that winter of her
eighth year.</p>

<p>There was a telephone linking the Coast Guard stations
on the beach with one at Quogue on the Island itself,
but direct communication with the ordinary system
there was none. On one side of the living room of the
Quogue Station was the beach phone, on the opposite
wall was a &#8220;local and long distance.&#8221; Members of the
Quogue crew, called up on either wire, obligingly relayed
messages along the other.</p>

<p>In this manner it was made known to Cap&#8217;n Smiley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
one February morning that his sister wished to see
him.</p>

<p>The keeper was privately astounded. So far as a
hasty recollection served him, his sister had never before
asked to see him about anything. The bay could not
be crossed and he sent her word to that effect, thinking
that she might disclose her purpose. Her reply, toned
down by the drawl of Surfman No. 3, Quogue Station,
was merely for him to visit her as soon as possible and
to bring the little girl.</p>

<p>While waiting for the bay to freeze smooth, or clear
from further thaws, Cap&#8217;n Smiley had some uneasy moments.
He had never taken Mermaid to his sister&#8217;s and
he did not like the idea. She had seen the little girl;
had met him walking with Mermaid on the streets of
Blue Port; had stopped to exchange a frosty word or two
and then had walked on, ignoring the child completely.
What could she be up to now?</p>

<p>He was so uneasy that he raised the question, in a
guarded way, with Ho Ha. He could do this, for Ho Ha
knew all about his sister, and without actually saying
very much, both could say a good deal.</p>

<p>&#8220;My opinion she has some proposition to lay before
you,&#8221; commented Ho Ha.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care to consider propositions,&#8221; replied the
keeper.</p>

<p>Ho Ha drew his weathered cheek together with his
fingers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>&#8220;It might advantage Mermaid some way,&#8221; he
suggested.</p>

<p>The keeper made a motion indicative of distrust.</p>

<p>About a week elapsed before the bay froze hard.
Mermaid, in many layers of wool, with a red muffler
about her throat, trotted down to the bayside where her
Dad put her in the scooter. Then as the odd little craft
gathered way, he half reclined so as to steer with her jib
and roll about handily to ballast her.</p>

<p>They shot along at a mile a minute or better. The
air was like impalpable ice pressing against Mermaid&#8217;s
small cheeks and roaring in her ears. She could hardly
open her eyes for the rush of tears. She shouted, but
could barely make herself heard. It was all over in
five or six minutes. The five-mile stretch had been
crossed; Dad rounded to; the sail, so enormous a top-hamper
on so tiny a potbellied body, came down, and
they were off Blue Port, with only a little way to walk to
tread the reassuring, if rutty, earth.</p>

<p>Mermaid put her hand in Dad&#8217;s and they walked to
the old-fashioned and heavily shuttered house where
Keturah lived. She met them at the door and ushered
them into the living room, which was also the kitchen,
but very large, so that there was no sense of crowding.
A hot fire burned in the stove, and slowly Cap&#8217;n Smiley
divested Mermaid of her cocoon. It was a little butterfly
of an unusual sort that emerged. Keturah, looking
with a severe, impassive face at the proceeding, said at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
last, without altering a muscle of her face or softening
her customary tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;She looks very much as you would have looked,
John, at her age, if you had been a girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her brother stared at the child with a gentleness in
his eyes that left them when he glanced at his sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to adopt her, John?&#8221;</p>

<p>The answer came with decision.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I shall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about her schooling?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall arrange for that next year. She knows her
letters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take her here and look after her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The keeper was startled, but he had long kept himself
in hand in the presence of his sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; he paused slightly, &#8220;but I shall send
her to the Biggleses&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keturah, as if recalling the duties of hospitality, said,
&#8220;Sit down. I&#8217;ll make a cup of tea. Do you like bread
and jelly?&#8221;</p>

<p>The question was directed at Mermaid. The child
had been eyeing the woman with attentiveness. Now
she answered politely, though she did not smile:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fond of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keturah Smiley entered her pantry and emerged with
a brown jar and a loaf. She cut two large slices, spread
them, and set a teapot on the stove. She said no more
until the tea was brewed. As she poured out two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
steaming cups of it she remarked, pushing one toward
her brother:</p>

<p>&#8220;What I leave of Aunt Keturah&#8217;s property goes to you.
As I am not a spendthrift, in the natural course of events
I would leave you more than I inherited. If you die
before me it goes to your children. It would go to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>John Smiley swallowed too hastily and burnt his
throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is not a matter to discuss before Mermaid,&#8221; he
said, shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I sent for her because I wanted to have a good look
at her, and I wanted you to have her to look at while you
choose,&#8221; Keturah rejoined. &#8220;At first I thought it
would not go to an adopted child, and so did Judge
Hollaby. But he looked it up and the wording of the
will is such that he thinks it would. I said once, to him,
that if you ever adopted a child I would give or throw
away every cent of that money. I was a fool; I can be
as big a fool sometimes as any one else, brother.&#8221; It
was on the tip of her tongue to add &#8220;yourself included,&#8221;
but she checked it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;ve had a good look at her. You take a good
look at her, too. I know you more than half hate me,
but that&#8217;s neither here nor there. Let the girl live with
me and go to school and you can adopt her if you like,
and I&#8217;ll do all I can in reason for her. Send her here to
live with the Biggleses, and I&#8217;ll keep my promise to
Judge Hollaby!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>The tight-lipped rather hard-visaged woman was
determined, but she was curiously excited, too. Her
rather flat chest rose and fell with her breath, and her
breathing was almost audible in the stillness of the room.
Mermaid, who had finished her slices of bread, looked
with wonder, but with a childish gravity and apparently
a suspension of judgment, at this strange woman. The
little girl knew who she was: she was Dad&#8217;s sister, but
evidently as unlike him as possible. Still, her Dad&#8217;s
sister was entitled to respect and a certain deference, if
not to affection. They were talking about money and
Dad was angry. She had never seen him so angry, not
even when her youngest uncle, Uncle Joe, had capsized
the life boat in the surf.</p>

<p>John Smiley was indeed mad clear through. Only
the presence of Mermaid restrained him. He stood up
in all his height and placed himself squarely in front of
his sister, his hands clenching and unclenching and
clenching again.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can take your money, Keturah,&#8221; he said,
rather slowly, &#8220;and give it away or throw it away, as
you please. I don&#8217;t care what you do with it. But
there are some things it won&#8217;t buy you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know money means nothing to you, John,&#8221; said
Keturah, sarcastically, &#8220;but it might mean something
to someone else. You&#8217;re forgetting her, John, you&#8217;re
forgetting the girl. Money can&#8217;t buy me some things
I want, maybe, and it can&#8217;t buy you some things you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
want, maybe; but it can buy her things she&#8217;ll want.
You&#8217;ve no right to throw away her chance!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her brother, his eyes on the child, seemed just perceptibly
to waver, and then he burst out:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s at the bottom of this? What are <i>you</i> after?&#8221;</p>

<p>Keturah, calmed a little by the success of her argument,
answered him:</p>

<p>&#8220;It might be just wanting to have a young and growing
creature around me, John! It might be that I&#8217;m
not the inhuman creature you take me for, that I&#8217;m
sometimes lonely; that company would cheer me up;
that I might even be a softer body than I&#8217;m generally
considered to be if I had someone to talk to and listen
to and work for and with! It might be all that, but I
won&#8217;t tax your powers of belief, brother, by asking you
to suppose so. No! The real reason is simply this&mdash;&#8221;
her excitement returned and she appeared almost
feminine in her rage&mdash;&#8220;that I am just human enough,
and just woman enough, and just fool enough to hate
having people say my own brother couldn&#8217;t trust his
adopted daughter to live with me, and had to farm her
out to Susan and Henry Biggles to care for!&#8221;</p>

<p>The keeper was impressed. There was no denying
Keturah spoke the truth, so far as her own feeling was
concerned. She, who cared nothing for the good will
of her neighbours, for gossip, for backbiting, for well-earned
dislike or worse, she, Keturah Smiley, with her
grasping ways and her old clothes and her bitter tongue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
had a streak of femininity&mdash;or plain humanity&mdash;left
in her after all these years. She could still care for
public opinion on some things. They might call her
stingy, mean, heartless in many ways; they might laugh
at her, sneer at her, and hate her for many things; but
that they should hold her in contempt; that they should
be able to say that her own brother would not trust her
with his little girl&mdash;that she dreaded. The prospect of
it cut her like a lash. She might not care what people
said about her behaviour toward John Smiley&#8217;s wife, for
John Smiley&#8217;s wife had run away and left him, taking
their baby, and so had sealed her unworthiness. She
<i>would</i> care what people said about her behaviour toward
John Smiley&#8217;s daughter, whether a daughter of his own
blood or a waif washed ashore from the ocean. She
cared about that now and she would continue to care.
John Smiley saw this and knew that he held a hostage
for her good behaviour. While the feeling lasted, anyway....
He spoke gently:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mermaid, would you be willing to live with my
sister here, and go to school?&#8221;</p>

<p>The child, with the soberness that was so unlike her
usual mood, but that had been evident since she entered
the house, looked straight at him and then straight at
Keturah Smiley. She had gathered that a matter of
importance was at stake. It might be that she could
help her Dad in some way, doing this. She said clearly
and gravely:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, Dad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keturah gave no demonstration of pleasure. She
was not triumphant, but she seemed genuinely relieved.
She looked at Mermaid with a stern sort of satisfaction,
and said nothing.</p>

<p>As they left the house and headed for the bay Mermaid&#8217;s
hand closed in a tight pressure over the keeper&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll come to see me as often as you are over, won&#8217;t
you, Dad?&#8221; she asked him, anxiously.</p>

<p>His answer was to lift her in his arms and kiss her.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">PART TWO</h2></div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">ON THE morning of the last day of October,
several years after it was decided that Mermaid
should live with Keturah Smiley in Blue Port,
a thin, pleasant-faced boy stopped in front of Keturah
Smiley&#8217;s house and whistled. Thereupon a girl of
eleven slipped out of the second front door of the house,
the front door that faced the street from a jog on the
south side of the building, and ran out to meet him.
She was as tall as the boy, and he was thirteen; she had
long and slightly curling hair of so coppery a red as almost
to match the polished mahogany in Keturah
Smiley&#8217;s tight-shut front parlour. She had a very
white skin, accentuated by three freckles of varying
size on and about her straight little nose. The firm and
rounded chin was without a dimple, but two dimples
showed in her cheeks as she smiled, and she was smiling
now; and her blue eyes were of that brilliant and flashing
blue that is to be seen, as seamen say, &#8220;off soundings.&#8221;
People who had occasion to say much to Mary
Smiley, whom everyone in Blue Port called Mermaid,
were frequently deceived by her eyes. The blue of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
them was so light that it seemed shallow, nothing more
than the reflection of the day&#8217;s sunshine or the quicksilvering
on two round little mirrors reflecting the merry
heart within her. Only a mariner, after all, could be
expected to guess that the very brightness and blueness
was a sign of unfathomable depths.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Richard Hand, Jr.,&#8221; said the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Howdy, Mermaid,&#8221; retorted the boy.</p>

<p>They looked at each other a moment and smiled.
They had become chums at school on the day they discovered
an uncle in common. But Hosea Hand of the
Lone Cove Coast Guard Station, known as Ho Ha, was
Dick Hand&#8217;s real uncle, the brother of his father,
whereas he was only Mermaid&#8217;s uncle by adoption.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-night&#8217;s the night,&#8221; said the boy, amicably offering
a jawbreaker. Mermaid accepted the candy and
said, with her mouth full, &#8220;I&#8217;ve unfastened most of &#8217;em,
so if the wind doesn&#8217;t blow and make them bang, they&#8217;ll
be all ready for you. All you&#8217;ll have to do is unhinge
them. Do you suppose you can do that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;They&#8217;re just ordinary shutters.
Maybe a little rusted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I oiled some of them while she was up street yesterday,&#8221;
the girl reassured him.</p>

<p>They were conspiring, as a Hallowe&#8217;en prank, to detach
as many shutters as possible from Keturah Smiley&#8217;s
tightly shuttered house; and particularly, the shutters
were to be got off the windows of the sacred, sealed front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
parlour. In the three years or more that Mermaid had
been living with Cap&#8217;n Smiley&#8217;s sister these shutters
had been unfastened but twice a year: for a few hours in
spring and a few hours in fall at the time of Keturah
Smiley&#8217;s semi-annual housecleaning. For six months,
from spring to fall, and again for six months, from fall
to spring, the front parlour and most of the other rooms
of the house lay in darkness. It seemed impossible that
anything, even dust, could enter there, but dust there
always was when cleaning time came. At which Mermaid
used to wonder greatly, and Keturah Smiley to
rage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you suppose it comes from?&#8221; the girl
would ask Miss Smiley.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know where it comes from, but I know where
it&#8217;s going to,&#8221; Keturah replied, with such a savage
accent as to make her remark almost profane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hell?&#8221; inquired Mermaid.</p>

<p>Miss Smiley straightened up and looked at her
sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was only asking a question,&#8221; explained Mermaid.
&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t think of saying &#8216;hell&#8217; except to ask a question.
But any one who says &#8216;hell&#8217; is asking a big question,
isn&#8217;t he, Miss Smiley?&#8221;</p>

<p>The funny child, as some folks in Blue Port called
her, was not expressing her doubt for the first time.
She had first shocked a Sunday School teacher with it.
The Sunday School teacher had spoken to Keturah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Smiley but had regretted it immediately, for Keturah
had said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s the matter? Can&#8217;t you convince her
there&#8217;s a hell? That&#8217;s <i>your</i> job! Why put it on me?&#8221;</p>

<p>So now when Mermaid put the general inquiry as to
whether any one saying &#8220;hell&#8221; were not asking a big
question, Keturah merely gazed at her darkly and
replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Most likely he&#8217;s answering one about himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>This tickled Mermaid. She renewed an old controversy
concerning the front parlour.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use of singing, as we do at Sunday
School, &#8216;Let a Little Sunshine In,&#8217; if the shutters are
always fastened?&#8221; she demanded. &#8220;How can you
expect me to stand up and sing, &#8216;There&#8217;s Sunshine in
My Heart To-day,&#8217; Miss Smiley, when there&#8217;s not
even sunshine in the house?&#8221;</p>

<p>Keturah snorted. &#8220;My heart is not as big as my
house,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Sunshine in some people&#8217;s
hearts, like sunshine in some people&#8217;s houses, would
show up a good deal that would better be hidden.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mermaid&#8217;s blue eyes shone, even in the semi-darkness.
From the very first she had liked living with
her Dad&#8217;s sister, despite that sister&#8217;s dark moods and
bleak rages, because Keturah Smiley had a gift for
saying sharp, true things, and saying them so you
remembered them. She had not been unkind to the
girl and had even shown a certain grudging liking for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
her as Mermaid, whether from some natural gift or from
crossing blades in conversational fencing, developed a
faculty for thinking her own thoughts and putting them
in her own words&mdash;and more and more the right words.</p>

<p>They had many duels, and Keturah Smiley did not
always win them. She early found in the child a
streak of obstinacy as pronounced as her own. When
Mermaid was convinced of her right Keturah might be
able to silence her, but she would not be able to move
her. And sometimes, to her dumb astonishment,
Miss Smiley found herself giving ground.</p>

<p>She had had to yield in quite a number of instances.
When the eight-year-old girl had come to live in Blue
Port she had refused to sleep with Miss Smiley, and
Keturah had been forced to open a small bedroom for
her after the night when the child had run out of the
house and fastened herself in the woodshed. Mermaid
had declined to walk two miles in the noon recess of
school and Keturah found herself putting up a lunch
and having the hot meal of her day at suppertime.
This had irked her a good deal, for Mermaid would not
merely walk but run two miles at play. The girl refused
outright to wear to school a man&#8217;s old coat fixed
over as a jacket. She was as contrary as possible, it
seemed to Keturah, about her clothes. After repeated
quarrels on the subject, in the last of which Mermaid
had threatened to appeal to her Dad the next time he
came over from the beach, Miss Smiley gave in. For it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
was true that her brother gave her money to clothe the
child, and she knew him well enough to know that he
would make her account for every cent of it. Keturah
Smiley was strictly honest, but it galled her to put
money on any one&#8217;s back. She would not even buy a
mustard plaster, though she would buy those mustard
plasters which went by the name of first mortgages&mdash;when
she could get them sufficiently cheap. But she did
not starve the girl; she set a good table. She was stingy
with money and affection, but not with food and principles.</p>

<p>In three years she had come to respect her brother&#8217;s
adopted daughter, and sometimes to wonder where the
girl got her firmness of character and general good
humour. Keturah had never seen her in tears. Once,
when she had been so angered as to lift her hand with
a threat to strike Mermaid, the girl, without wincing,
had said quietly:</p>

<p>&#8220;If you hit me I&#8217;ll go away.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had not said she would tell her father. She had
never, in any of their disputes, threatened to appeal to
Cap&#8217;n Smiley except in the long dispute about what
she should have to wear. And she had explained that
at the time by saying: &#8220;It&#8217;s only that Dad is buying
them. If he says you&#8217;re right, that&#8217;ll settle it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keturah never reopened the argument. She put the
money in the girl&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Missy, spend the last cent and wear
ribbons!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>But Mermaid had insisted on Miss Smiley&#8217;s going
with her to the shop, and had followed her advice on the
quality of the goods, which Keturah shredded with her
fingers along the selvage and bit, a thread at a time,
with her very sound (and very own) teeth. Mermaid
had then made her own selection of styles and patterns,
and on the way home had handed Keturah $5 with the
remark: &#8220;Will you send that to the savings bank in
Patchogue for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It might have been twice as much,&#8221; was Keturah&#8217;s
only remark.</p>

<p>&#8220;And it might have been twice as little. And I
might be half as happy,&#8221; Mermaid exclaimed. &#8220;Would
you be twice as happy if you had twice as much money,
Miss Smiley?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be willing to try and find out,&#8221; said Keturah,
sententiously.</p>

<p>Mermaid looked at her speculatively. &#8220;If there&#8217;s
a chance of it, I&#8217;ll help you all I can to get rich!&#8221;
she declared with so much seriousness that Keturah
was uncertain how to take her, and so took her in
silence.</p>

<p>Probably Mermaid&#8217;s words were not really so ironical
as they sounded. The girl was generally in earnest
when she was not plainly in fun; as children usually
are. She had only the vaguest notion of Miss Smiley&#8217;s
means, and a very vivid notion of her money-stinting
ways; Mermaid, however, liked her Dad&#8217;s sister in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
spite of the difficulties of living with her. Miss Smiley
was &#8220;square&#8221; for all her harshness and even hardness;
she said cutting things which were, however, never
mean, and seldom really unkind. She could be wrathful,
but she did not sneer, and she had only scorn for
those who sneered at her. Very little mercy, but a
rigid adherence to what she thought just, distinguished
Keturah in the girl&#8217;s eyes. And no one, Mermaid concluded,
could live with Miss Smiley and not be struck
by the fact that she was thoroughly unhappy. What
would make her happy Mermaid had not the least idea;
but if the child could have given it to the woman she
would have done it, even at some cost to herself. For
she was a generous child and she felt generosity all
about her, guarding her, befriending her, helping her.
Her Dad&#8217;s and her uncles&#8217; liberality to her always
touched her heart. She knew now, at the age of eleven,
that her Dad was not really her Dad and that her
uncles were not related to her by blood or marriage.
She knew she was a nameless child of unknown lineage,
washed ashore from the wreck of the ship by whose
name she was known. Everyone except Miss Smiley
called her Mermaid; Miss Smiley called her Mary
when she called her by name at all, or &#8220;Missy,&#8221; when
Mermaid had irritated her. From the first the girl had
called the woman Miss Smiley; it had never occurred to
her to address her as &#8220;Aunt Keturah,&#8221; and no one, not
even her Dad, had suggested it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>In the evening of the day when Mermaid ran out
to meet young Dick Hand on the sidewalk, sprites
were abroad. As if it had conspired with Dick and
Mermaid, the wind refrained all day long from blowing
and rattling Keturah Smiley&#8217;s unfastened shutters,
and thus giving the two youthful conspirators away.
But at night there came a wrenching sound, as if the
broadside of the house were being ripped off. Keturah
Smiley gave an exclamation and jumped to her feet.
She rushed from the room and returned a moment later
carrying a pistol.</p>

<p>Mermaid saw it and screamed. Then she flung herself
at the woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no! Miss Smiley,&#8221; she implored in little gasps.
&#8220;It&#8217;s only boys! It&#8217;s only Hallowe&#8217;en!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; Keturah retorted, holding the pistol
out of reach and checking the girl with her other hand.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to murder &#8217;em. I&#8217;m only going to
frighten &#8217;em into behaving themselves, and leaving my
property alone!&#8221;</p>

<p>She moved quickly to the door, opened it, and fired
two shots. From the darkness came an awful cry, as
of mortal pain, followed by whimpers and the sound of
scurrying feet. Keturah became utterly pale, and her
tall figure seemed to lose its rigidity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose one of those boys could have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
perched in the big maple?&#8221; she inquired, faintly. &#8220;I
shot in the air!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a great rushing about and the woman and
girl finally went outside with a lantern. The light
bobbed about under the maple and around the house,
but no white, stricken face was illuminated by the rays;
they heard no other cries, no moans; and except for the
rustle of the fallen leaves they trod upon there was no
sound. Gradually recovering herself in the chill air
Keturah strode indoors, Mermaid following her. Miss
Smiley, as her fright left her, became more and more
indignant.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that Dick Hand&#8217;s boy,&#8221; she commented.
&#8220;Always up to mischief, like his father. A bad lot,
the Hands, all except Hosea, who&#8217;s a fool.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this mention of her Uncle Ho Mermaid pricked
up her ears. Miss Smiley was in a talkative mood,
seeking relief from her vexation. The girl could not
refrain from asking, &#8220;Is Uncle Ho a fool?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he is, to have let his brother cheat him out of
his rightful property all these years,&#8221; Keturah Smiley
told her.</p>

<p>Mermaid felt a pang.</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncle Ho is awfully good to me,&#8221; she said, sadly.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t have anything to do with Dick if his father
cheated Uncle Ho.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keturah gave her a curious look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make other folks&#8217; quarrels your quarrels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Mary,&#8221; she observed. &#8220;And while &#8216;the boy is father
to the man,&#8217; Dick Hand&#8217;s boy may be a better man than
his father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t be friends with Dick if his father cheated
Uncle Ho,&#8221; the girl persisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;You go on being friends with Dick,&#8221; Keturah advised
her, &#8220;and leave me to deal with his father.&#8221;</p>

<p>A strange, grim expression was on her face, an
expression which had more of satisfaction in it than
Mermaid had ever observed before, an expression that
was almost happy, and that was not unknown in Blue
Port. The senior Richard Hand had seen it on the
day when he first came to Keturah Smiley to borrow
money. His brother, Hosea Hand, had never witnessed
it; and Hosea Hand thought he knew every
shade of Keturah Smiley&#8217;s countenance&mdash;a countenance
that was singularly inapt at denoting the finer shades of
feeling. For Hosea Hand had even seen a look of
tenderness in those sharp eyes; he had seen that mouth,
so firm at the corners, relax into smiles at the smile he
gave her. Once upon a time Hosea Hand had been
young, and once upon a time Keturah Smiley had been
young, and it was about that time that Hosea Hand&#8217;s
brother&mdash;of whom a reasonable doubt might be entertained
as to whether he had ever been young at all&mdash;that
Dick Hand, the older, had come between two
lovers.</p>

<p>In the morning three shutters were gone from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
front parlour windows and the streaming sunshine had
already, according to Keturah Smiley&#8217;s emphatic pronouncement,
begun to fade the old rose carpet. What
was worse, the shutters could not be found, though
what appeared to be their ashes lay, still smouldering,
in a lot a quarter of a mile away. Keturah poked
through the black remains and fished out a peculiarly
shaped hinge, adding to her observations of the evening
before on the badness of the Hands. But she expressed
no intention of putting her hand in her pocket to buy
new window coverings. With a wrench that bade
fair to take them from their rollers she pulled down
the parlour shades. Yet a spell had been broken. The
sacred room could never regain its dark repose. Mermaid,
dusting the mahogany &#8220;deacon&#8217;s chairs,&#8221; ventured
discreetly to raise the shades a little at the bottom,
and gradually they rose higher and higher until they
shielded the upper sashes only. An agreeable light
streamed into the room and lit up the curios brought
back from his sea voyages by Captain John Hawkins,
husband of Keturah Hawkins and master of the clipper
ship <i>China Castle</i>, curios that Keturah Smiley had inherited
from Keturah Hawkins along with the house
and her aunt&#8217;s land and money. Though not more
wonderful than the full-rigged ship which Uncle Ho had
carved in the glass bottle, these heirlooms were perceptibly
more precious.</p>

<p>There was a jade Buddha which, on its first appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
in Blue Port fifty years earlier, had administered its
shock to the Christian ladies of the Missionary Society,
and had long been retired into oblivion. There was
a collection of swords and cutlasses with which Keturah
Smiley might have defended herself against all
Blue Port advancing against her. On a mantel were
ivory ornaments, intricately carved, and on either
side of the fireplace were mammoth elephants&#8217; tusks.
Gold gleamed from damascened swords; silver bands
shone more coldly from the tusks; some copper vessels
on the floor dully reflected the unaccustomed daylight;
but the precious stones which had once enhanced
the beauty of these relics of far ports had been
removed from their settings and their fires smothered
forever in the feathers of a pillow on Keturah Smiley&#8217;s
four-poster bed.</p>

<p>Mermaid used to look at the empty sockets and
express sorrow that all these must once have held
jewels which had been lost. She took an imaginative
joy in restoring them, in her mind&#8217;s eye, to their rightful
places, and in deciding just what gem belonged with
every background. She had a sense in these matters,
and she never enshrined a diamond where a ruby
should have been bleeding.</p>

<p>Of the permanent results of their Hallowe&#8217;en pranks
she apprised thirteen-year-old Dick Hand when they
met at school. She told him of some of the treasures
brought to light, but she said nothing of the value of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
them and she never spoke of the vanished jewels. She
was curious, however, about the cry of pain and the
whimpering that had frightened Miss Smiley on the
night of the raid. Dick, who was a merry boy, laughed.
&#8220;Oh, we knew she&#8217;d fire a pistol in the air; she&#8217;s done
it before. I just made those noises to scare her,&#8221; he
explained.</p>

<p>Then, as Mermaid laughed with him, the boy became
suddenly earnest. He looked at the girl with an air of
surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Mermaid, you&#8217;re an awful nice girl,&#8221; he said,
and looking at her he slowly reddened. In a moment
he recovered himself and finished successfully,
&#8220;An awful nice girl to be living with that&mdash;that&mdash;<i>old
cat</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mermaid was really indignant. She told him so, and
then she left him, which was not what he wanted at all.
He hardly knew what he wanted. As for Mermaid, she
was too incensed to be observant; she was certainly not
aware that he wanted anything. The boy stood looking
after her faintly dismayed, but a good deal more
perplexed. Then he scratched his head, gave a whistle
to another boy across the street, and sang out: &#8220;Hey,
Tom! Did you find out who that new feller is on your
street?&#8221;</p>

<p>Young Tom Lupton, son of Tom Lupton of the Lone
Cove Coast Guard Station, and therefore one of Mermaid&#8217;s
cousins by courtesy in the queer relationships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
that sprang out of her rescue from the surf, waggled his
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;C&#8217;m over and I&#8217;ll tell you all about him,&#8221; he invited.</p>

<p>Dick crossed the street and punched Tom&#8217;s head in a
comradely fashion. They clinched, broke away, sparred
a little, and then stopped, breathless and satisfied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Search me,&#8221; replied Tom Lupton 2nd, less in the
voice of entreaty than with the air of a man making a
succinct statement. &#8220;I tried to talk to him to-day over
the fence and the guy only said &#8216;Yes&#8217; and &#8216;No&#8217; to
ever&#8217;thing. I got his name&mdash;that Guy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Dick, innocently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guy,&#8221; answered Tom. &#8220;Ow!&#8221; He doubled over to
protect his ribs from the impatient Mr. Hand. &#8220;I
told yuh, Guy! Guy! His name is Guy! Like&mdash;like
&#8216;Guy Mannering,&#8217;&#8221; explained Mr. Lupton, who was
fifteen and didn&#8217;t look it, and was taking English I in
Patchogue High School, and didn&#8217;t speak it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mannering, what sort of a name is that?&#8221; demanded
Mr. Hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t Mannering, it&#8217;s Vanton,&#8221; said Tom, wisely
not trying to explain. Whereupon Mr. Hand, remarking,
&#8220;You said it was Mannering, I&#8217;ll Mannering you!&#8221;
fell upon him afresh and they punched each other
happily for several minutes until a shadow fell athwart
them.</p>

<p>Stopping to see who approached, they were almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
borne down by a huge, elderly man who walked with a
peculiar tread, planting his feet firmly at each step and
taking short steps. His preoccupied and lordly expression
took no cognizance of the young men as he
went through them, like a massive keel cutting in two a
couple of sportive little waves.</p>

<p>Immense sidewhiskers, like studding sails, expanding
the spread of his ample countenance, fluttered in the
breeze. His weathered cheeks looked hard as the sides
of a steel ship; there was a stony, distant stare in his eyes,
wrinkled at their corners. He wore a coat cut like a
huge boy&#8217;s reefer; there were brass buttons on it and his
hands were thrust in the pockets.</p>

<p>The boys gazed at his wake, and when he was out of
all possible hearing young Mr. Lupton nudged his companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s him!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;That&#8217;s Captain
Vanton, this Guy&#8217;s father. You know they say he was
master of a three skysail-yarder that made a passage
from New York to Honolulu in 90 days. Doesn&#8217;t he
look like a Damn-Your-Eyes?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dick agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;A regular brute!&#8221; ejaculated Tom. &#8220;Must have
wads of money. Built that house and it&#8217;s finished in
mahogany and teakwood like a ship&#8217;s cabin&mdash;cost a
fortune! He must have been in the slave trade, eh?
Where does a sea captain get all that money, even if he&#8217;s
been master of a clipper ship?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>Dick, who reeked naught of the sea and cared less,
didn&#8217;t know.</p>

<p>&#8220;That kid of his,&#8221; the garrulous Tom continued,
&#8220;he&#8217;s a regular sissy. I s&#8217;pose his father frightens the
life out of him. Probably flogs him with a rope&#8217;s end
before breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he coming to school?&#8221; inquired young Mr. Hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Naw. Leastways, I don&#8217;t believe so,&#8221; Tom responded.
&#8220;He&#8217;d been by this time. They were here
before school started. Why, it&#8217;s months since they
moved into that house, and none of &#8217;em has ever so
much as spoke to anybody in Blue Port. They eat
their meals at the Roncador House, but they never go
<i>anywhere</i>. Not even to church.&#8221;</p>

<p>Everybody went to church in Blue Port. The information
was astounding. The two boys agreed that
a real mystery invested the Vantons; and as for Captain
Vanton, he must have done something hellish to have so
much money and hold so aloof and walk down Main
Street as if it were his sacred quarterdeck on the queenly
<i>China Castle</i>.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>The <i>China Castle</i>! She had been a wonderful ship
in her day, a Bath-built clipper. John Hawkins, husband
of Keturah Hawkins, uncle by marriage of Keturah
Smiley, had been the first master of her; Captain
Vanton had come to her cabin much later, in the days of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
her decline. It was John Hawkins and not Buel Vanton
who had made the passage from New York to Honolulu
in 90 days. Young Tom Lupton had not known or remembered
the name of the three skysail-yarder whose
glory descended upon every master who trod her
quarterdeck. Only a few persons in Blue Port, indeed,
recalled anything when they heard that Captain Vanton
had been master of the <i>China Castle</i>. &#8220;Eh?&#8221; said these
old fogies to each other. &#8220;She was John Hawkins&#8217;s
ship!&#8221; This Captain Vanton could not, of course, have
been the mariner that John Hawkins was, for Captain
John had sailed his fine, fast vessel to California, making
quick passages, and afterward took her into the China
trade for which she had been built. Nevertheless, out
of a sense of politeness, these oldtimers had, on one
occasion or another, attempted to address Captain
Vanton; it was a sort of duty to let him know that he
was not a total stranger in Blue Port. No man could
have a better sponsor than a ship John Hawkins had
sailed. They were frozen by Captain Vanton&#8217;s hard
stare. At the mention of the <i>China Castle</i> he merely
looked through their eyes and out the backs of their
heads and into the bar of the Roncador House. At
the various polite and hearty references to &#8220;Cap&#8217;n
John Hawkins&#8221; he had but one course of behaviour:
uttering a loud &#8220;Humph!&#8221; he would turn squarely on
his heel, and lurch away evenly in the opposite direction.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>An exasperating man; did he think himself above
everybody ashore, as if he were still the master of a
vessel? Be hornswoggled if <i>we&#8217;d</i> go out of our way
again to speak to such an uncivil devil. He could take
his money and his pindling boy and his sick wife&mdash;she
always appeared to be just convalescing&mdash;and shut himself
up in his expensive house and be hanged to him.
Why, Cap&#8217;n John Hawkins!&mdash;and then the oldtimers
would go off into reminiscences all wool, a yard wide and
the afternoon long, sitting about the stove in the store
and postoffice in winter or in back-tilted chairs on the
store porch in summer. When Captain Vanton came in
for his mail there was a momentary silence, faces were
carefully averted, and tobacco juice was sprinkled on
the floor.</p>

<p>Buel Vanton never noticed the idlers. He never
noticed anybody. Therefore Mermaid was stricken
almost mute with astonishment one day when, answering
a peremptory rap at the door, not the side front door,
but the frontest front door leading into the small hall
that gave into the front parlour, she opened it to find the
bulky form of Captain Vanton standing before her. As
usual he did not look at her, but merely asked in a loud,
hard voice if this had been John Hawkins&#8217;s house.
Mermaid affirmed it; he then asked if her mother were
in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Smiley is in. She is not my mother. I just
live with her,&#8221; the girl replied. Captain Vanton made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
no response, but as he continued to stand there she
added, &#8220;I will call her.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not invite him to enter, and as she went in
search of Keturah Smiley she murmured to herself,
&#8220;Rude old man! She can ask him in, I won&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>Keturah Smiley, summoned, confronted the visitor
and asked abruptly, &#8220;You wish to see me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Vanton did not indicate whether he did or
not. His eyes dropped for the merest instant and he
replied: &#8220;I was told this was John Hawkins&#8217;s house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was in his lifetime,&#8221; said Keturah, shortly. &#8220;He
was my uncle,&#8221; she added. &#8220;Mother&#8217;s sister&#8217;s husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Vanton made no reply. He said, as if it
were relevant: &#8220;I commanded the <i>China Castle</i> after he
left her. Some time after,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Did he ever
speak of a man named King?&#8221; And now he looked
Keturah Smiley straight in the eyes. Keturah gave his
stare back.</p>

<p>&#8220;King?&#8221; she rasped. &#8220;I can&#8217;t say he did, and I
can&#8217;t say he didn&#8217;t. What King?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;First officer, Boston to Shanghai, third voyage,&#8221;
answered Buel Vanton in his hard, uninflected tones.
&#8220;Triced up by the thumbs and flogged before the crew
by Captain Hawkins&#8217;s orders. First officer, too! Insulted
Mrs. Hawkins.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keturah Smiley&#8217;s face settled into its severest lines.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re likely mistaken,&#8221; she said with a bite in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
words. &#8220;Captain Hawkins would never have flogged a
man for that: he&#8217;d have killed him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did almost. Killing too easy. Better to flog.
Torture,&#8221; declared Buel Vanton, reflectively. &#8220;Afterward
Captain King. Knew him in San Francisco.
Retired. Devil. Swore he&#8217;d get even. Then Captain
Hawkins died. King heard of it. Near crazy. I&#8217;ve
come to tell you he&#8217;s dead!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dead?&#8221; echoed Keturah Smiley, who had become
slightly confused by the visitor&#8217;s elliptical language.
&#8220;Captain Hawkins is dead. Of course he&#8217;s dead, what
of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not Hawkins, King!&#8221; barked Captain Vanton from
his impassive face framed in the spreading sidewhiskers.
&#8220;He&#8217;s done you all the harm he ever will. All of you.
He&#8217;s dead. &#8216;The King is dead. Long live the King!&#8221;&#8217;
He uttered a harsh sound, a bitter laugh. Turning
squarely about he started off the porch and away from
the house. Keturah Smiley, who had been eyeing him
with amazement, suddenly called after him, &#8220;How do
you know he&#8217;s dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Vanton half turned his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Killed him myself,&#8221; he declared abruptly, and
lurched away.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Standing well back in the hall Mermaid had heard
this extraordinary conversation. Now she slipped into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the front parlour ahead of Miss Smiley, who stood,
apparently forgetful or stunned, for two or three
minutes in the open doorway. Then she closed the
door with a bang, entered the front parlour, and went
through it into the living room. She stood before the
stove a moment, warming her hands. Her face was
working and her mouth was twisting, but her lips remained
closed. Mermaid looked at her with deep
sympathy and with a certain terror at the memory of
what she had just heard. Neither emotion drowned the
awful curiosity within the girl to know what it had all
been about. But she dared not ask questions.</p>

<p>In silence the two got their supper, in silence they ate
it. Once Keturah Smiley sighed, once she spoke, but
only to say: &#8220;Thank the Lord, John will be coming over
to-morrow!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mermaid, who had been looking forward to this visit
of her Dad, thinking he might give her a scooter ride on
the smoothly frozen bay, said: &#8220;How rich do you suppose
Cap&#8217;n Vanton is, Miss Smiley?&#8221;</p>

<p>Keturah looked at her absently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not rich enough to buy an easy conscience, probably,&#8221;
she replied, drily. Mermaid hesitated, and then
took her courage in both hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Smiley, I heard some of what he said. I&mdash;I
guess I heard most of it,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Keturah showed neither surprise nor anger. She
looked at Mermaid attentively and there was a flicker of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
interest in her eyes as she asked: &#8220;Well, and what did
you make of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He said he&#8217;d killed a Captain King!&#8221; the girl blurted
out. &#8220;How could he do that and not be in jail for it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe he has been,&#8221; Keturah suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;But then how could he be so rich?&#8221; persisted Mermaid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe it isn&#8217;t his money,&#8221; Miss Smiley replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to be now.&#8221; Mermaid rested on the fact,
solidly buttressed by all appearances.</p>

<p>&#8220;So it does,&#8221; agreed the woman.</p>

<p>But she was at some pains, the next day, to talk to her
brother only after Mermaid had had her scooter ride and
had gone out to do errands at the store.</p>

<p>&#8220;When he first spoke of &#8216;a man named King,&#8217;&#8221; Keturah
explained to John Smiley, &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t make the
connection. Then I remembered the entry about the
flogging in Uncle John&#8217;s log of that passage. Aunt
Keturah was with him on that voyage. The log only
says that the mate refused to obey orders. I never
heard Aunt Keturah utter a word of such a thing, but
it&#8217;s perfectly possible; more than that, it&#8217;s likely.
Mates, first mates, weren&#8217;t flogged before the crew for
insubordination. There was something personal, I
suspect. As for his&mdash;this fellow&#8217;s&mdash;having killed King,
that&#8217;s neither here nor there with us. He said King had
done us all the harm he ever would, but what harm did
he ever do? Uncle John and Aunt Keturah lived to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
peaceful old age and died comfortably in their beds&mdash;leastways,
I suppose they were as comfortable as a person
can be dying.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the &#8220;Captain King&#8221; struck a full chord of
memory in John Smiley&#8217;s breast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember?&#8221; he cried. &#8220;That miserable
devil we found on the beach after the wreck of the <i>Mermaid</i>,
one of the crew? Remember I told you I sat up
all night with him and that I made out from his delirious
talking that a &#8216;Captain King&#8217; had had the little
girl, and had been sending her back to someone? He
wanted to keep himself out of it and he wanted &#8216;forgiveness&#8217;&mdash;at
any rate, that was one word in the letter we
found in the pocket of the <i>Mermaid&#8217;s</i> skipper.&#8221; He was
deep in the painful process of recollection. &#8220;But still
I can&#8217;t make head nor tail of it,&#8221; he confessed. &#8220;This
man King may have hated John Hawkins and been
willing to do anything he could to hurt him, he may
have hated Aunt Keturah, but they&#8217;re dead and that&#8217;s
an end of them! As for his harming us, he never could
have had a chance. And as he&#8217;s dead he&#8217;ll never get
one. And that&#8217;s an end of <i>him</i>! Captain Vanton says
he killed him, and probably if he did it was a good job.
He must have thought that King had bothered us somehow.
Thoughtful of him to come and assure us that
the dirty dog&#8217;s dead. I suppose,&#8221; he continued, reflectively,
&#8220;I might go see him and talk with him. Perhaps
he may have learned something from King that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
will set us on the track of Mermaid&#8217;s people. I&#8217;ll
go!&#8221;</p>

<p>Keturah was inclined to dissuade him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He thinks,&#8221; she said, with her usual shrewdness,
&#8220;that we know something we don&#8217;t know, and that he
does know. Or else,&#8221; she wavered, &#8220;he&#8217;s after something,
and if we go after him we&#8217;ll be playing right into
his hands. I don&#8217;t know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She came to a dead stop
for a moment, and a rare look of uncertainty, almost
of panic, appeared in her eyes. &#8220;Better keep away, John.
Better wait and see what he does. If he comes around
here bragging of having killed another man I&#8217;ll ask him
for the death certificate.&#8221; She had recovered her usual
poise. And when her brother repeated his intention
of calling on Captain Vanton she merely remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t mind hearing how you&#8217;re received.&#8221;</p>

<p>The interview between Captain Vanton and John
Smiley was extremely short and, to the keeper of the
Lone Cove Coast Guard Station, hopelessly baffling.
Captain Vanton, with more courtesy than Keturah had
shown him, ushered her brother into a room which resembled
nothing so much as a ship&#8217;s cabin. He seated
his visitor, but himself paced up and down the floor, a
very fine floor which seemed to have been freshly
scrubbed and holystoned until it was of the whiteness of
an afterdeck. Cap&#8217;n Smiley came to the point at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;The little girl who lives with my sister is my adopted
daughter,&#8221; he began. &#8220;She was rescued from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
wreck of the <i>Mermaid</i>.&#8221; He went on to tell of the few
decipherable words in the letter found on the body of
the <i>Mermaid&#8217;s</i> skipper; then of the delirious sailor who
had talked of &#8220;Captain King.&#8221; Captain Vanton
paced to and fro in perfect silence. He seemed not to
be paying attention, but to be thinking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything you may have learned that would help us
to find out the child&#8217;s identity&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; John Smiley
began, and then he stopped with a sudden sinking of the
heart. If Mermaid&#8217;s identity were established he
would probably lose her! The thought gave him,
as he afterward put it, &#8220;a turn.&#8221; He never finished
his sentence, and while he was recovering himself
Captain Vanton uttered his first words of the conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know&mdash;knew of&mdash;the child,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;He
sent her back. Yes. No, I don&#8217;t know anything that
would make matters any better than they are.&#8221; He
did not look through Cap&#8217;n Smiley, as was his customary
way with people, but seemed to avoid his eye.
He frowned at the floor as he might have frowned at the
deck if the holystoning and cleaning had not been
thorough. John Smiley, rising, thanked him and took
his departure. The sense of relief at the thought that
Mermaid would not be taken from him was so strong
that he felt not in the least disappointed, but really
grateful for Vanton&#8217;s reticence. Captain Vanton may
even have thought him effusive in his thanks. Keturah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Smiley heard her brother&#8217;s report of his failure with
calmness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he wear the scalp at his belt?&#8221; she inquired.</p>

<p>Mermaid appearing, they all sat down and had a hot
supper after which Cap&#8217;n Smiley and Mermaid played
checkers and Keturah walked about with a yardstick in
an effort to decide where she would have three shelves
put up. She had a passion for shelves and drawers.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are these shelves to be for, Miss Smiley?&#8221;
asked Mermaid, looking up from the board after she had
beat her Dad for the third time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Medicine, most like,&#8221; Keturah, told her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not for our books?&#8221; Mermaid suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bottles break,&#8221; said Keturah, concisely. &#8220;Do
you prefer books to medicine? Not when you&#8217;re sick,
I&#8217;ll warrant!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I do,&#8221; Mermaid insisted, and then she explained
to her antagonist with a smile:</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, Dad, it&#8217;s because&mdash;it&#8217;s because books can
make you happy while you&#8217;re dying, but medicine can
only make you miserable while you&#8217;re getting well!&#8221;</p>

<p>Keturah gave the girl a look in which a skilled
observer might have detected something resembling
admiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;What an upside-down mind you have, child!&#8221; she
said. &#8220;But then,&#8221; she allowed, &#8220;you use it and do
your own thinking!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish she&#8217;d do some of my thinking,&#8221; exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Cap&#8217;n Smiley, looking ruefully at the checkerboard.
&#8220;Appears to me as if I had been out-thunk again!&#8221;
He liked the defeated, &#8220;ker-plunk&#8221; sound of this past
participle of his invention, and always used it to describe
Mermaid&#8217;s victories.</p>

<p>Mermaid got up, went to the pantry, came back with
a pan of sugared crullers, offered her Dad one, took
one herself, put up the pan, and then cuddled contentedly
against his arm. &#8220;I made them myself,&#8221; she
murmured.</p>

<p>Her Dad stroked her hair. It was remarkably like
the colour his own had been before thirty years of beach
sunshine&mdash;and other things&mdash;had bleached the colour
out of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to be when you grow up,
Mermaid?&#8221; he asked, dreamily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall try to make you a good home and keep you
happy,&#8221; she assured him. &#8220;I&#8217;m knitting the slippers
you&#8217;ll wear, now.&#8221;</p>

<p>They hugged each other in anticipation of their
peaceful old age together, and went to bed.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>Sometimes it isn&#8217;t what you don&#8217;t know about people
but what you do know that makes them mysterious, as
Mermaid once said.</p>

<p>She did not say it respecting the senior Dick Hand
but she might well have done so. Richard Hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
First was not only his proper designation but his motto,
his war-cry, his watchword, and his slogan. Richard
Hand first and everybody else nowhere, just about
summed up the golden rule in Blue Port. Richard
made the rule and Blue Port lived up to it.</p>

<p>If Blue Port had been a pretty good-sized town, like
near-by Patchogue, with a couple of mills, two or three
banks, an electric light company, and other rudiments
of an American municipality, Dick Hand would have
owned them all&mdash;not outright, of course, but as the
heaviest shareholder and the preferred creditor. But
Blue Port had none of these things. Blue Port had only
a two-three of stores, a justice of the peace (Judge
Hollaby), an unorganized oyster industry, a faded little
railroad station, and a postoffice. Nearly all the people
in Blue Port got their living on or from the Great
South Bay. They went oystering, fishing, eeling,
clamming, duck shooting. They kept, some of them, a
cow and a few pigs; all of them raised vegetables. Thus
there was plenty to eat. There was not so much to
wear, but there was enough. As for making money,
mostly no one made any money. There was no way to.
A few hundred dollars in cash, to buy a few clothes and
pay, perhaps, a low rent, was enough for a whole
family from one year&#8217;s end to the other. Such a place
might be considered, and rightly, to offer very restricted
opportunities for the capitalist, but Dick Hand made
it do.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>He was not a daring financier. For years he had
lived on a farm in the middle of Long Island, a farm in
semi-hilly country, the farm left him by his father. It
had to be worked hard, and when, after some dozen
years of labour, the chance came to Dick Hand to sell
it at a fabulous figure, he lost no time in doing so. A
wealthy New Yorker had come along and bought the
place simply because he saw in the lie of the land possibilities
for a corkingly good private golf course. The
course was never laid out. The New Yorker died
while still quarrelling with his architect over the plans
for a $200,000 summer &#8220;cottage,&#8221; and his executors
and heirs looked ruefully at the large tract of land
which had been his latest whim and which was difficult
to &#8220;turn over&#8221;&mdash;even with a plough. But Dick Hand
had received $20,000 in cold cash for 200 acres. He
was satisfied.</p>

<p>It was an impressive lot of money. It would have
been greeted respectfully in Patchogue, and even in
larger places. But the sudden possession of so much
riches made Mr. Hand more cautious than ever. How
to make it grow fastest?</p>

<p>He had had enough of land. By most wonderful
fortune, he had been enabled to convert land into
money. It was a miracle. Water had been turned
into wine; he would not depend upon it happening
again. His wife, who had always been submissive to
him, ventured a single suggestion:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>&#8220;Now would be a good time to straighten out matters
with Hosea,&#8221; she remarked. Dick Hand looked at
her coldly. She went on, uncomfortably: &#8220;I s&#8217;pose
&#8217;twouldn&#8217;t take so much. It wasn&#8217;t more&#8217;n $2,500, his
share of father&#8217;s estate, was it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He had no share of the estate,&#8221; her husband answered,
shortly. &#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, Fanny, how often
have I got to tell you that there wa&#8217;n&#8217;t nothing for
him.&#8221; Under stress of emotion Mr. Hand used colloquial
speech. &#8220;The will read plain: I was to have
the farm and he was to have the rest to do as he
pleased with, but after father&#8217;s debts had been paid
there wa&#8217;n&#8217;t nothing. I stood ready to mortgage the
farm if nec&#8217;ssary to give him what he&#8217;d oughter had,&#8221;
said the man, virtuously and untruthfully&mdash;doubtless
he thought his wife would readjust her recollection
accordingly&mdash;&#8220;but he run away and went to sea.
Stayed away for years, and me struggling with the
farm.&#8221; Mr. Hand began gradually doing himself
justice as a heavily laden, plodding, self-sacrificing
figure. &#8220;When he finally showed up I offered to do
what was right and he sneered at me, the ongrateful
and onnatural brother. I says to Hosea, &#8216;I&#8217;m ready to
forget and forgive. Bygones kin be bygones.&#8217; He
was courting Keturah Smiley. It was before her aunt
died, and she hadn&#8217;t a cent. O&#8217; course it was plain
she&#8217;d have prop&#8217;ty some day, though no one could
foresee she&#8217;d have all the Hawkins&#8217;s money. John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Smiley hadn&#8217;t married that Mary Rogers then. So
after I&#8217;d talked with Hosea and offered to do right by
him&mdash;and more&#8217;n right, considering how he&#8217;d acted&mdash;I
went to Keturah Smiley, and told her just how things
stood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Richard, you hadn&#8217;t ought to have done that,&#8221;
Mrs. Hand murmured. &#8220;You had ought to have kept
out of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe I had, maybe I had,&#8221; retorted her
husband. &#8220;But I was never one to reckon the consequences
of doing a neighbourly act. I was trying
to do the square thing, and more&#8217;n square, by Hosea.
So I went to Keturah and I says to her: &#8216;Hosea won&#8217;t
take this money. Of course,&#8217; I says, &#8216;there&#8217;s no
claim upon me for it, and never was a valid claim, but
I always wanted to do the utmost by the boy and I
want to be generous to the man; even if he has behaved
badly and said things to me he oughter be ashamed of,
and will be some day, I don&#8217;t hold it against him. I
harbour no resentment,&#8217; I says, &#8216;and if he won&#8217;t take
this money I wish you would. Every one knows,&#8217; I
went on, &#8216;that you&#8217;ll have prop&#8217;ty some day and you
can pay me back then if you feel you should. Or,&#8217; I
continued, wanting to make it as easy as I could for
her, &#8216;you can give me your note o&#8217; hand for the amount
at six per cent., and I&#8217;ll promise you it won&#8217;t leave my
hands. I&#8217;ll shave it for nobody,&#8217; I says, reassuring
her, &#8216;and nobody need ever know about it unless you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
want to tell Hosea about it afterward to bring him to a
proper appreciation of the onnatural things he said to
his brother.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Hand, who had been clasping and unclasping
her fingers, exclaimed: &#8220;But, Richard! Don&#8217;t you
think &#8217;twas a mistake to go to Keturah with it? A
girl is so likely to misunderstand such matters.&#8221;</p>

<p>A look of inscrutable sorrow crept into Mr. Hand&#8217;s
crafty eyes. He hunched up his shrunken body and
nodded earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes-yes!&#8221; he confirmed, using a characteristic
ejaculation of the Long Islander. &#8220;Keturah was
never the woman to understand things in any but her
own way. She flared right up at me and said some
hard things. I won&#8217;t repeat&#8217;em, though I remember
some of &#8217;em to this day. For one thing,&#8221; he went on,
disregarding his promise of the breath before, &#8220;she
accused me of trying to cheat Hosea&mdash;to <i>cheat</i> him!
She p&#8217;tended to think I was trying to keep from
Hosea what was rightfully his, when I was right there
trying to give it back! She says to me: &#8216;I&#8217;ve heard of
folks who wanted to eat their cake and have it, too,
but you&#8217;re the first ever I see that wanted to give someone
else his bite and have it back.&#8217; Then she cried out:
&#8216;I wouldn&#8217;t marry a man with a brother so mean as
you!&#8217; I went away a good deal upset, for I was real
consarned to see her married to Hosea and them both
happy. Hosea didn&#8217;t have nothing, but she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
sure to have plenty from her aunt, and I figgered
&#8217;twould be money in the family.&#8221; Mr. Hand shook
his head regretfully and a sigh whistled between his
teeth.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hand smoothed her apron. After a few moments&#8217;
silence she observed: &#8220;Well, I s&#8217;pose it&#8217;s all for
the best.&#8221; It was her favourite observation, and on
the philosophy compressed into that one short sentence
she had managed to live, hardly but not so unhappily,
with Richard Hand for these many years. She wanted
to ask him what he was going to do with the extraordinary
sum of $20,000 of which he was now possessed,
but she knew he would not tell her. Afterward, she
would learn, little by little. She did not have to
worry, for he was not likely to lose it. She fell
to speculating as to whether he would give her
enough to buy a black silk dress for Sundays&mdash;but
it was an idle speculation.... Her thoughts
went along in an ineffectual fashion until she rose to
get supper.</p>

<p>Her husband ate in silence, undisturbed by his boy&#8217;s
chatter about the people of Blue Port, to which they
had just removed. His mind was already occupied
with the possibilities of $20,000 carefully handled, as
he would handle it. He would not buy land, he would
buy people. He would look about for good mortgages
that could be picked up cheap. There must be a few
Keturah Smiley had not got hold of. He would go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
slow and keep money in the savings bank for a while,
even though it yielded him only a miserable four per
cent. If something good came along he would have it
handy. Perhaps he could organize some industry and
have people working for him directly. He liked to
drive people. The oyster industry, for example&mdash;there
ought to be something in that for a man who
would use a little capital and get control of the trade.
Blue Port oysters were famous the world over. A
little legal work would be necessary; the thought of
paying a lawyer hurt him, but there were papers that
would have to be drawn up, articles of incorporation,
etc. He would stop in and talk with Judge Hollaby
to-morrow.</p>

<p>The upshot of this meditation ultimately was the
formation of the Blue Port Bivalve Company, Richard
Hand, president; Horace Hollaby, vice-president and
secretary; Richard Hand, treasurer. The company
gradually obtained liens on most of the boats in which
the men of Blue Port went forth to dredge the oyster
beds. It acquired these beds. There were also free
beds, belonging to the township, but as Richard Hand&#8217;s
company came to own the boats it suffered less and
less competition. Everything went on about as before;
the only difference was that everybody came to be in
debt to Richard Hand and worked for him. The only
person in Blue Port who remained independent of him
was Keturah Smiley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Mermaid, hurrying down the street from school, did
not notice a boy coming out of the side street on which
young Dick Hand lived. The boy was walking along
with a most unboyish air. His head was down and he
looked up too late to avoid a collision. It nearly
knocked Mermaid&#8217;s breath out of her. When she could
talk she accepted his confused apology, and smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re Guy Vanton, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was a short boy with very black hair, a snub
nose, and a pale face. His eyes, which were brown,
had something uncanny about them; Mermaid was
struck with their resemblance to the eyes of wild animals.
She had seen deer with eyes like that. The
boy stood before her with his cap in his hand; he was
somehow not in the least like Dick Hand or Tommy
Lupton or any of the other Blue Port boys. He
seemed to have very good manners and to be politely
exercising them. Mermaid unconsciously assumed her
own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guy Vanton, yes, <i>mademoiselle</i>.&#8221; The French
word aroused Mermaid to a high pitch of curiosity, and
the immediate effect of her heightened curiosity was
to make her still more polite.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I beg your pardon,&#8221; the boy repeated. &#8220;It
was all my fault. I was not looking where I was
going, <i>mademoiselle</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>She noticed that he spoke English without the Blue
Port twang, but also without a foreign accent; his
speech was like that of one or two of the schoolteachers
she had had.</p>

<p>He seemed about to replace his cap and hurry away.
He made a little bow to her&mdash;from the waist. Mermaid
had seen the bow before. Dickie Hand had
learned it in a children&#8217;s dancing class at Patchogue.
She smiled at young Mr. Vanton, who was so eager to
get along. She had no intention he should go until
they were fairly acquainted.</p>

<p>&#8220;You speak French?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Mais oui, mademoiselle!</i>&#8221; His uncanny eyes fixed
her for a moment and his pale face flushed a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t speak it,&#8221; Mermaid explained, hastily,
whereupon he looked down at the ground, as if he had
lost interest. &#8220;What was that you just said?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said: &#8216;But yes!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I knew it,&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;I should love
to study it, but I don&#8217;t think they teach it even in High
School at Patchogue.&#8221;</p>

<p>He said, without looking at her: &#8220;I learned it in
Paris. I&mdash;we used to live there. My mother&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
He stopped.</p>

<p>Mermaid said, sympathetically: &#8220;She&#8217;s an invalid,
isn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that isn&#8217;t&mdash;I mean&mdash;why, why, yes. She is&mdash;she
has to walk with a crutch. And then, only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
little.&#8221; His confusion was so evident that Mermaid
felt sorry for him. With true feminine instinct she
decided that he must suffer some more so that ultimately
she might help him. She knew he did not go
to school, she knew that he lived all alone, shut up in
that expensive house, surrounded by gloomy evergreens,
which must be as sunless as Miss Smiley&#8217;s front
parlour had been once on a time. He lived there with a
crippled mother and a formidable father, a retired sea
captain who was undoubtedly a stern disciplinarian.
He was pale and undersized. Mermaid had heard
stories of sea captains all her remembering life and
knew them to be a peculiar race of men. Her imagination
worked rapidly on the problem presented by
Guy Vanton, and she concluded, perhaps somewhat
rashly, that his father had spent most of his money on
the mahogany and teakwood of the parlour and fed his
boy on ship&#8217;s biscuits and water. At any rate, he
looked it. But his eyes fascinated her. Considering
briefly the means of further advancing their acquaintance
she decided that he should teach her French.
In turn, she would ask him home with her to supper,
and see that he got a square meal.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if you wouldn&#8217;t teach me French?&#8221;</p>

<p>Guy Vanton looked surprised, but then an expression
of pleasure came into the brown eyes. He nodded.
Mermaid continued: &#8220;I could come over in the afternoon,
sometimes, when I haven&#8217;t to help Miss Smiley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
clean house. We could be very still and not bother
your mother. And sometimes you could come to our
house. I&#8217;m sure Miss Smiley wouldn&#8217;t mind. I bring
Dickie Hand there and she gives him cookies though
she hates his father like anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were walking along the street together.
Young Mr. Vanton had got his cap back on his head at
last, but he walked stiffly, a little deferentially, his body
half turned toward the girl. Mermaid chattered along
easily on whatever themes came into her head, occasionally
punctuating her talk with a question calling for
no answer more elaborate than a &#8220;Yes&#8221; or a &#8220;No.&#8221;
She was much gratified when Dick Hand and Tommy
Lupton stopped their regular afternoon pastime of
punching each other&#8217;s heads to stare across the street
at her escort. She heard Dickie say to Tom: &#8220;Well,
will you look? Girls make me sick!&#8221;</p>

<p>As if this were the very effect she desired to produce,
Mermaid was remarking to the Vanton heir: &#8220;That&#8217;s
Dick Hand over there, and Tommy Lupton. You
know them, don&#8217;t you? Dick is thirteen and Tommy&#8217;s
fifteen. I&#8217;m only eleven, but I&#8217;m as big as either of
them. You&#8217;re fifteen, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m seventeen,&#8221; he divulged. Mermaid stood
still in her astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seven-teen!&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;Why, but you&#8217;re no
bigger than Dickie&mdash;though you know French and he
doesn&#8217;t, and you know a lot more than he does and are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
lots&mdash;lots nicer,&#8221; she added, by way of retrieving her
blunder. &#8220;But you won&#8217;t want anything to do with
me,&#8221; she said with honest candor. &#8220;You&#8217;ll think I&#8217;m
only a little girl. I suppose I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not seem ready to cast her off as infantile and
beneath his notice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am too small,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;I was not so
small in Paris&mdash;I mean, the boys at school there were
not so large as fellows of the same age here. I was
average height. Here I&#8217;m a little&mdash;runt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a lot you must have seen,&#8221; Mermaid marvelled.
&#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll tell me all about it. You can
do that and teach me French that way, can&#8217;t you?
I&#8217;ve never been anywhere except here and on the beach.
You know I came ashore in a shipwreck.&#8221;</p>

<p>She told him about the wreck, what she had heard
of it from her Dad and other men of the Lone Cove
Station; of her home with Keturah Smiley, and of life
on the beach. Then she spoke of Captain John Hawkins
and the clipper ship <i>China Castle</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know your father commanded her afterward.&#8221;</p>

<p>Guy did not seem to know it. &#8220;He never talks about
his ships,&#8221; the boy explained. With the help of some
questions from Mermaid, he told her about himself.</p>

<p>He had been born in San Francisco and had lived
there for some years. In the Presidio section of the
city. As he talked of the town Mermaid&#8217;s face took
on a puzzled look.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>&#8220;It&#8217;s the funniest thing,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;Do you
know, I have a feeling that I lived there once on a time.
It seems as if it came back to me, as if I just sort of
half-remembered&mdash;&mdash; You know the <i>Mermaid</i>, the
ship I was aboard, came from San Francisco.&#8221;</p>

<p>After they left San Francisco, the Vantons had gone
to live in Paris. Guy&#8217;s father had then given up definitely
all idea of going to sea again.</p>

<p>&#8220;He had really never had a ship since I was born,&#8221;
the boy explained. &#8220;But he kept thinking, up to the
time we went to Paris, that he would take another
command. My mother&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he hesitated, with a
trace of the confusion he had shown before in speaking
of her, and then went on: &#8220;We had plenty of money,
and so there was no need for him to go, but in San
Francisco he kept thinking of it, and every day he
would walk down to the foot of Market Street and along
the waterfront and look at all the ships. Sometimes
he would go aboard them and talk to the captains. He
used to take me with him. It was very interesting.
Ships from all over the world&mdash;British, Japanese,
American, German, French, Norwegian, Russian and
a lot more. He would take me on board the square-riggers
and teach me the ropes. &#8216;This,&#8217; he would say,
&#8216;is the fore t&#8217; gallant halyard. This is the fore royal
sheet. This is the fore topmast stays&#8217;l sheet. Now
what is this?&#8217; I always got it wrong and it used to
make him terribly angry. Then he would tell me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
go aloft. I liked that, because you could always get
such a splendid view of San Francisco Bay and the
city, built on hills, and the mountains over in Marin
County, with Oakland and Alameda and all the other
places spread out before you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Weren&#8217;t you dizzy?&#8221; Mermaid asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only the first time.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had reached Keturah Smiley&#8217;s house. Mermaid
invited little, old Mr. Vanton in. She gave him
crullers and coffee, made him acquainted with Miss
Smiley, and then said good-bye to him at the gate.
It was agreed that they should meet the next afternoon
<i>pour parler Français</i>. As the French instructor hurried
homeward he lit a cigarette. This was observed by
the Messrs. Hand and Lupton, who were considerably
dazed.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I called him a sissy,&#8221; murmured Mr. Hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;ye know what I think?&#8221; exclaimed his side
partner. &#8220;He&#8217;s a foreigner, that&#8217;s what he is, a
cigarette-smoking foreigner. Mermaid ought not to
have anything to do with a fellow like that,&#8221; Tommy
concluded, virtuously, and with the sense of the protecting
male.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Mermaid and Monsieur Guy Vanton made friends
with each other quickly, aided, perhaps, by the graces
of the French language. At eleven years it is not hard to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
learn French, especially if your instructor speaks with a
pure accent and makes conversation in it the order of
the day. Mermaid found that Guy did not go to
school because his father didn&#8217;t wish him to, for reasons
not given. Guy said he didn&#8217;t know what was back of
his father&#8217;s objections, unless it was that he would have
to go away from home. &#8220;You see, I&#8217;ve had the
equivalent of high school,&#8221; he told Mermaid. &#8220;It
would have to be college&mdash;or maybe a year somewhere
to get ready for college. I don&#8217;t much care. I read a
lot&mdash;we&#8217;ve heaps of books&mdash;and I&mdash;I write sometimes,&#8221;
he confessed, diffidently.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you write?&#8221; Mermaid ventured. &#8220;Say
it in French,&#8221; he reminded her and after he had corrected
her question so put, he replied in French:
&#8220;Mostly poetry.&#8221;</p>

<p>He got quite red, so that Tommy Lupton, who had
been dishonourably spying from behind a shrub in the
next yard, was incensed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some day I&#8217;m going to knock his block off,&#8221; Tommy
told himself.</p>

<p>Afterward he accosted Mermaid down the street,
greeting her calmly but with a touch of sadness in his
tone. She was a nice, if misguided, girl; Tommy
didn&#8217;t want to hurt her feelings but this business
couldn&#8217;t be allowed to go on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Mermaid,&#8221; he began, and then faltered a
moment in the performance of his unpleasant duty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
&#8220;We&mdash;we never see anything of you any more these
days,&#8221; he finished. It was not just the thing, but it
was, perhaps, best to lead up to the point gradually.</p>

<p>Mermaid seemed unaware that anything was wrong.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come down to the house, Tommy, and I&#8217;ll give you
a cookie,&#8221; she invited him sweetly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I want a cookie. I don&#8217;t believe I
want anything to eat,&#8221; answered Mr. Lupton, seriously.</p>

<p>Mermaid looked at him with attention. &#8220;You
aren&#8217;t sick, are you?&#8221; she said, anxiously. &#8220;There&#8217;s
two cases of scarlet fever in Patchogue, I heard. You
ought not to be going there to high school if you feel
that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Indignation at the turn the conversation was taking
overcame Mr. Lupton. He did not want to talk about
himself but about Mermaid, and particularly about
the dangerous acquaintances&mdash;well, acquaintance&mdash;she
was cultivating. He abandoned the possible diplomatic
approaches to the subject and blurted out:
&#8220;What do you want to have anything to do with that
Vanton feller, for, anyway, Mermaid? If we fellers
don&#8217;t have anything to do with him I shouldn&#8217;t think
you&#8217;d&mdash;you&#8217;d&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He stuck hopelessly.</p>

<p>Mermaid&#8217;s very bright blue eyes were on him and he
found it difficult to collect his thoughts and present his
argument.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d&mdash;have him around,&#8221; he concluded,
unhappily.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>Mermaid lifted her chin and her eyes flashed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to know, Tommy Lupton, what <i>you</i> know
about him, anyway!&#8221;</p>

<p>Just the opening Mr. Lupton craved. He poured it
all out eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why, he&#8217;s a regular sissy, Mermaid, and you
know it. He&#8217;s a&mdash;a hermit. I mean he never mixes
with us fellers, and of course we&#8217;re glad of it; we
wouldn&#8217;t have anything to do with him,&#8221; Tommy
assured her, not bothering the logic. &#8220;He&#8217;s some kind
of a foreigner, probably a dago,&#8221; he inferred, darkly.
&#8220;He smokes cigarettes.&#8221; Mr. Lupton, who smoked only
cornsilk in secret, saw the distinction clearly. &#8220;If you
don&#8217;t look out some of these days he&#8217;ll be putting his
arm around you!&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped, appalled at his own frankness. But
Mermaid merely laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s <i>not</i> a foreigner; he only just speaks French.
He lived in Paris and learned it there,&#8221; she said quite
easily. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t make him a foreigner; besides,
he learned good manners, Tommy. And as for his not
mixing with you and Dickie and the rest, he&#8217;s older and
doesn&#8217;t go to school&mdash;and anyway, you never go near
him. I don&#8217;t care if he does smoke. <i>You</i> smoke.
Only you hide, and he doesn&#8217;t! I guess if he&#8217;s seventeen
and has lived abroad where everybody smokes
early he can smoke if he wants to. I guess if his father
didn&#8217;t think it was all right he&#8217;d stop him. If he puts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
his arm around me and I need your help I&#8217;ll scream,
Tommy, and when you come I&#8217;ll tell him you kissed
me at your last birthday party! Will you fight him,
Tommy? While he was in Paris he learned all about
duelling, and you two can have a duel. I&#8217;ll steal one
of the swords from our front parlour and you can
practise with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Lupton was perfectly red with rage and white
with mortification. He was two colours, and presented
an alarming spectacle. Mermaid, done with taunting,
suddenly approached him and laid her hand on his
arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be mad, Tommy. I was only teasing. Of
course he&#8217;s different from you and Dick, but he&#8217;s lived
in strange places&mdash;in San Francisco and Paris&mdash;and
he&#8217;s moved around a lot. And he has a sick mother
and a queer father. You&#8217;d be funny in his place.
And queer. And he&#8217;s seventeen, Tommy, and no
bigger than you and I are! Don&#8217;t you think you could
eat a cookie?&#8221; she asked, solicitously.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only&mdash;only that I think such a lot of you,
Mermaid,&#8221; he protested. His natural dignity reasserted
itself. &#8220;I&#8217;ll walk home with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The procession formed, two abreast, and they went
on toward Keturah Smiley&#8217;s. Mr. Lupton ate three
cookies and an apple and examined, with an air of
interest, the swords and cutlasses in the front parlour,
which he had never handled before.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>&#8220;Does Vanton really know how to fight with a
sword?&#8221; he ventured, curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;He had fencing lessons. Not a sword, a rapier,&#8221;
Mermaid explained. &#8220;A sharp point that you stick
into the other man. I think I&#8217;ll get him to give me
lessons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What would a girl be doing with fencing lessons?&#8221;
exclaimed Mr. Lupton, scornfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know. Just exercise. It might be
useful sometime,&#8221; said Mermaid, vaguely.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re just thinking of something you two can do
together.&#8221; Jealousy reawakened in Mr. Lupton&#8217;s
bosom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he writes poetry, and we can&#8217;t write poetry
together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but he can write it and read it to you,&#8221; the
youth said, bitterly. &#8220;Wishy-washy stuff, poetry.
All except &#8216;Marmion,&#8217;&#8221; he qualified.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Tommy, don&#8217;t be foolish,&#8221; sighed the young
woman.</p>

<p>An amusing thought struck Mr. Lupton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait till I tell Dick he writes poetry,&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;Ow! Won&#8217;t he yell? Won&#8217;t he?</p>

<p>&#8220;Just like a foreigner to stab a man with a thing like
this,&#8221; Tommy continued, imperilling the haircloth
seat of one of the &#8220;deacon&#8217;s chairs&#8221; with an unskilful
lunge.</p>

<p>At this Mermaid lost all patience.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>&#8220;He&#8217;s <i>not</i> a foreigner!&#8221; she snapped. &#8220;And if you
think he can&#8217;t put up his fists you just try him some
day. I&#8217;ll bet you&#8217;ll find you made a mistake!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Lupton sulked for a moment, but recovered, and
after borrowing a book and eating two more cookies
took a calm departure. On the highway, however, the
thoughts that had disturbed him returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just the same I&#8217;ll have to give him a good licking
yet, I bet,&#8221; he muttered. He hoped supper would be
ready, for he felt hungry after the strife and passions of
the afternoon.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Richard Hand the elder had come to own all Blue
Port with the exception of Keturah Smiley when the
balance of power, if you could call it that, was altered,
imperceptibly at first, by the advent of Captain
Vanton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Buel Vanton, Buel Vanton,&#8221; said Dick Hand, fretfully,
to his wife one morning some months after the
studding-sail whiskers became a familiar sight in Blue
Port. &#8220;Should like you to tell me who this Buel
Vanton is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Hand, whose frequent tattling of village gossip
made her more valuable to her husband than he ever
admitted, repeated such news as was current. She
described, not quite accurately, the mahogany and
teakwood parlour, expatiated on the invalid wife, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
was never seen outdoors, referred to the small boy.
It had got about that the boy was older than he looked,
and the father more brutal than he spoke, and the wife
as mysterious as she was invisible. The town figured
that Captain Vanton flogged the boy, or had flogged
him when he was little, thus arresting his growth;
probably he had made his wife an invalid by his cruelty.
Mrs. Hand repeated and worked speculative embroidery
on the meagre facts and unsatisfying conjectures.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; sneered Richard Hand, his eyes fixed
on his plate. &#8220;How much money has he got?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Hand didn&#8217;t know. And what made things
worse, there seemed absolutely no way of finding out.
Captain Vanton didn&#8217;t own property in Blue Port, except
a lot and the house he had built on it. He didn&#8217;t
even have an account at a Patchogue bank. He
sometimes made trips to the city, but they lived very
simply. The only evidence of wealth, after all, was the
costly fittings of that front parlour which no one in Blue
Port had ever entered since the Vantons moved in.
Mrs. Hand did not know of Cap&#8217;n Smiley&#8217;s short call.
Keturah Smiley never met &#8220;with the ladies&#8221; and never
talked any one else&#8217;s business unless it was her business,
too.</p>

<p>Her husband meditated aloud:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;F he has money,&#8221; he observed, &#8220;we might make
some effort to get acquainted with them. You could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
call on his wife. And Dick,&#8221; with a glance at his son,
&#8220;could make friends with his boy. I might stop the
Captain on the street some day and ask him how he&#8217;s
fixed to &#8217;nvest a little money in shares of the Blue Port
Bivalve Comp&#8217;ny.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dick Junior looked at his father rebelliously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Pop,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;I&#8217;m not a-going to have
anything to do with that Guy Vanton for you nor nobody
else. He&#8217;s&mdash;he&#8217;s a big softy!&#8221;</p>

<p>His father looked at the boy with his nearest approach
to good nature.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe that girl that lives with Keturah Smiley&mdash;what&#8217;s
her name?&mdash;some kind of fish&mdash;might tell you
something about him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Young Mr. Hand choked on the coffee he was swallowing
and rose from the table, though there were
three steaming pancakes left of the morning&#8217;s pile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why you insult Mermaid,&#8221; he said with a
comical boyish rage in his voice. &#8220;She&#8217;s a&mdash;a&mdash;nice
girl, even if that softy does get around her. Why&mdash;why,
I wouldn&#8217;t <i>think</i> of asking her anything about
that fellow. She might think I was jealous.&#8221;</p>

<p>Young Mr. Hand went out and wandered disconsolately
down the street, thinking miserably of Mermaid
and the three untouched pancakes. It was, however,
incompatible with his wounded dignity to make overtures
to either.</p>

<p>Old Richard Hand, shuffling down the street, looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
at the sidewalk, perhaps to see where he was going, perhaps
to see where someone else had been, did not observe
a large, heavy craft also outward bound but in the
opposite direction and on the other side of the thoroughfare.
No signals were exchanged and Captain Vanton,
studding-sails set, went careering on his way. It was
some time later when he showed up at the bare little
room which was Richard Hand&#8217;s place of business and
(except for Judge Hollaby&#8217;s office) the Blue Port
Bivalve Company&#8217;s headquarters.</p>

<p>Captain Vanton was under all plain sail to royals.
He was making ten knots or better when he entered the
shabby room. He towered over the puny form of
Richard Hand as might a great clipper, crowding her
white canvas, tower above a fishing smack under her
bows. And for a moment he appeared quite likely to
run down the village miser. Richard Hand could feel
himself cut in half and his wits drowning. He came
to his senses with an effort. After all, it was merely the
sea captain&#8217;s physical presence, aided by those expansive
whiskers. Stage stuff! With an inward sneer Mr.
Hand got hold of himself. He had always despised
whiskers and was clean shaven because he had never
been able to grow a beard. A beard would have covered
that nasty chin and those cruelly tight lips, and would
have softened the look in those eyes. With the benevolent
aid of a beard Richard might have been a deacon, as
his father had been before him; and he knew it. In a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
business way, it would have been an advantage to him,
now and then, to have been Deacon Hand. Though it
gave him the greatest possible satisfaction to collect
interest six days a week there was something painful
about the fact that none could be collected Sundays.
Deacon Hand, passing the plate, would have felt a
vicarious joy. The seventh day would not have been
entirely wasted.</p>

<p>Rising hastily, the thwarted deacon managed a familiar
but far from warming smile. &#8220;This is&mdash;er&mdash;Captain
Vanton?&#8221; he asked, in a suave tone very few persons
in Blue Port had ever heard.</p>

<p>The visitor did not say whether it was or was not.
He looked around, as he might have on coming on deck,
to see whether the mate was doing his work properly.
Richard Hand lugged a chair forward, but Captain
Vanton gave no sign that he noticed this. He spoke a
few words in his best quarterdeck voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;When did you last hear from Captain King?&#8221;</p>

<p>The effect on Richard Hand was curious. For a
moment his weak and vicious jaw dropped. A look of
immense distrust invaded his crafty eyes. Then he
seemed to recover himself. Rubbing his hands, as if
they were cold, as they doubtless were, Mr. Hand eyed
his questioner up and down a moment and then gave
question for question:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you a letter from him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Vanton, who had not hitherto looked at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
village miser at all, now turned and gazed squarely at
him, and with so cold and glittering and truculent an
eye that Mr. Hand seemed to become more shrunken
than ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Captain Vanton told him. Then he asked,
&#8220;Have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The village miser shuffled and cleared his throat. He
mumbled something, a negative apparently. There
was a moment&#8217;s silence which was broken by the Captain,
whose tone had a chilled steel edge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you answer my question, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not the polite &#8220;sir&#8221; of the land but the formal,
and often positively insulting, &#8220;sir&#8221; of the sea. Mr.
Hand had never been so set down in his life. There was
never much starch in him, and what there was went out
completely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I heard from him&mdash;why, quite recently, less than
a month ago, in fact,&#8221; he explained not very readily.
&#8220;But you&mdash;you have later news of him, I can see that.&#8221;
The Uriah Heep in the man came to the surface and old
Mr. Hand exhibited his favourite brand of cordiality&mdash;the
oily voice and the skimped smile. &#8220;Yes-yes. I
hope he is well!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is,&#8221; affirmed Captain Vanton and added non-committally:
&#8220;He is dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>An expression of shocked surprise appeared on the
face of the village miser. He made curious, clucking
noises.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>&#8220;Dear me. Dear me,&#8221; he managed to say, finally, as
an inadequate expression of his regret that Captain
King was well&mdash;and dead.</p>

<p>Captain Vanton glared at the opposite wall, resolutely
taking no notice of this contemptible land creature.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did he die?&#8221; pursued the much-affected Hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Violently,&#8221; barked Captain Vanton. The mortgage
miser recoiled. When he spoke again his voice
was feeble:</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you knew him very well?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Captain paid no attention to this. Suddenly he
turned and looked through Mr. Hand about two inches
to the left of the breastbone and in the latitude of the
third rib, where Mr. Hand&#8217;s heart should have been
sighted by the experienced mariner, if the miser had had
any. Mr. Hand could not have been more disconcerted
if Captain Vanton had pulled a sextant from his pocket
and taken an observation with that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you lie to me?&#8221; asked Captain Vanton at
length, and the tone which had made men perspire off
Cape Horn induced a cold kind of sweat on the body of
Hand, the miser. It really was the tone more than the
words, and surely the words were unpleasant enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you mean. I lie to you?&#8221; the
land crab got out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. Why, damn your eyes, you know you
haven&#8217;t heard from Captain King in a month, nor six
months, not a year!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>Mr. Hand stuttered in a process of recollection.
Captain Vanton muttered something about &#8220;chronometer
error&#8221; and seemed to swell up with a slow inflation
of wrath. He might have expanded with this
until the pinprick of the miser&#8217;s speech punctured the
envelope of his maritime self-command, but, as if some
thought arrested him, he stood still, and regarded Mr.
Hand attentively for the first time. Captain Vanton&#8217;s
regard was neither favourable nor unfavourable, and it
took no account of what Mr. Hand seemed to be trying
to say. &#8220;A month?&#8221; Of course he had been mistaken.
It must have been longer than that; much longer, come
to think it over. Several months and by gracious! it
might be a full year. Time slips by so fast, and he was a
busy man with the affairs of the Blue Port Bivalve
Company on his hands as well as personal business.
Investments. Couldn&#8217;t be neglected. Must be watched
night and day....</p>

<p>Mr. Hand trailed off easily into an account of the
operations of the Blue Port Bivalve Company. He
painted its bivalvular prospects. Aided by his descriptive
faculty Blue Port ceased to be Blue Port and became
another Golden Gate.</p>

<p>At the name of that entrance&mdash;and exit&mdash;to and from
El Dorado Captain Vanton&#8217;s large bulk quivered
slightly about the back and shoulders.</p>

<p>With fixed eyes he listened to all that Mr. Hand
poured forth, saying nothing, storing in his brain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
perhaps, some of these wonderful adjectives. Along
with the adjectives Mr. Hand delivered a well-assorted
general lading of information, in fragments
and pieces which Captain Vanton seemed to be carefully
ticketing for ready reassembling on some distant
pier.</p>

<p>At length Mr. Hand&#8217;s discourse dwindled. Would
Captain Vanton care to invest in the Blue Port Bivalve
Company&#8217;s shares? More capital was needed and
substantial men, men of affairs. But the man of
affairs, after drinking in all that Mr. Hand had
to say, shut up as tightly as one of Mr. Hand&#8217;s own
bivalves. He had nothing to say and said it. Mr.
Hand, concealing his disappointment, expressed the
hope that Captain Vanton would consider. The
Captain, who perhaps thought no answer necessary
in view of his very obvious consideration of something,
turned to go. And then it was that the same
stray thought that had struck Keturah Smiley struck
Richard Hand. How did he know of Captain King&#8217;s
death?</p>

<p>Captain Vanton explained in not more than three
words. They were, in fact, the same three words with
which he had answered Miss Smiley.</p>

<p>Richard Hand was left all of a tremble. &#8220;Killed him
myself!&#8221; A self-confessed murderer! Good God, what
was the world coming to that such men stalked about
in it!</p>

<h3>IX</h3>

<p>Tommy Lupton had made up his mind to knock the
block off Guy Vanton, and no suitable pretext or occasion
offering, he went around to the Vanton house one
day and rather awkwardly invited the objectionable
Guy to take a walk with him.</p>

<p>Guy Vanton, with a flicker of surprise which changed
quickly into a look of pleasure, accepted the invitation.
The two boys started north toward the woods encircling
a small pond. They said little to each other at first.
Tommy was concerned only to reach a small clearing
in the woods, a place carpeted with pine needles and
reasonably secure from intrusion by passersby. Guy
was puzzled by Mr. Lupton&#8217;s stride and a feeling that
this was somehow less a pleasure stroll than an errand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re almost through High School, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;
asked Mr. Vanton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Year more,&#8221; returned Tommy, going rapidly ahead
on the wood path.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall you go to college after that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cornell,&#8221; Tommy informed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the engineering course?&#8221; guessed Guy amicably.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the crew,&#8221; corrected Tommy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never rowed,&#8221; Guy commented, finding it
difficult to make conversation at the pace they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
travelling. &#8220;Except a little, on the Seine near Paris,
just for sport.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bragging of where he&#8217;s been,&#8221; thought the grim
young man beside Mr. Vanton. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give him something
to brag about!&#8221; Aloud he said: &#8220;Ever box?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;ve had fencing lessons. I used to wrestle a
little. Nothing else much.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had gained the clearing. Tommy moved to the
centre of it and then turned and faced his companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve brought you up here to tell you something,&#8221; he
began, white-faced and with blazing eyes. &#8220;You&mdash;you&#8217;ve
got to have nothing to do with&mdash;with her&mdash;with
Mermaid,&#8221; Tommy found it distasteful to name the
woman in the case, &#8220;from now on or I&#8217;ll knock your
block off. I think I&#8217;ll just do it, anyway,&#8221; shouted
Tommy, his fury, the accumulation of weeks of suffering,
breaking forth. &#8220;You don&#8217;t box, but you say you
can wrestle. I&#8217;m going to hit you and you can clinch
and we&#8217;ll see who comes out on top! Being a&mdash;a <i>damn</i>
foreigner I suppose you won&#8217;t fight fair, but if you try
biting or gouging I&#8217;ll <i>get</i> you, don&#8217;t you forget it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Guy Vanton, open-mouthed with surprise at the first
few words, had reddened with anger. His curious,
wild-animal eyes, ordinarily so shy, had lost their light
and were fixed steadily but unseeingly on the boiling
young man confronting him. The colour left his face.
He lowered his eyes, stepped back several paces, muttered,
&#8220;<i>En garde</i>,&#8221; and awaited Tommy&#8217;s onset.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>With a desperate sort of roar Tommy charged. His
blood was up, his head was down. His fist shot out but
only grazed Guy&#8217;s cheek. At the same instant his head
struck his antagonist&#8217;s collarbone, he felt himself caught
under the shoulders, and before he could steady himself
he was on his back on the ground. Young Mr. Vanton
made no effort to keep him pinned there. Tommy rose
and attacked again.</p>

<p>This time he flung himself on the other boy, head up
and ready to clinch. But he clutched the air. Something
slipped under his arm and caught his leg, throwing
him from his balance. As he staggered he was
picked up and thrown bodily a few feet through the air,
landing on his shoulder.</p>

<p>A sense of awful lameness came over Tommy as he
picked himself up. Unsteadily he planted a fist where
his opponent&#8217;s breathing apparatus should have been,
but wasn&#8217;t. He felt his head caught in a vise and
shoved downward with such violence as to make it seem
likely it had been permanently detached from his body.
Shoulders fitted themselves into the extended curve of
Tommy&#8217;s right arm; he half spun about like a tee-totum,
and then, having four legs instead of the usual two, at
right angles to each other, Tommy was uncertain which
way he faced. All four legs gave way under him, his
face brushed the pine needles, he turned a low somersault
and found himself lying on the soft and scented
earth, looking with a blurred vision at the tops of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
pine trees and a patch of blue sky. They faded from
sight after a second. Tommy was senseless.</p>

<p>Water trickling down his face awakened him, water
brought by his late antagonist. Young Mr. Vanton&#8217;s
black hair was in disarray, his normally white face
looked whiter than ever, and his strange eyes were
filled with anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tommy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Closing his eyes for a moment to consider whether
this referred to the late Tommy Lupton or to himself,
the young man with the wetted face decided that he
would take the chance that it was intended for him.
He opened his eyes again, sat up with a painful effort,
looked at Guy Vanton, and smiled&mdash;a sad, calm smile
such as befitted the victim of a mistake. But Guy Vanton
seemed to think he had made no mistake. He
flung himself on the ground beside the warrior and put
his arm about the warrior&#8217;s shoulders. The shoulders
gave a sharp twinge, but the warrior, with an effort,
reached up his arm and crooked it reciprocally about
the shoulders of the black-haired boy. So intertwined
they sat side by side on the pine needles for a moment,
and then Tommy struggled to his feet, the arm of the
other helping him. After a moment of dizziness
Tommy disengaged himself and held out his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shake!&#8221;</p>

<p>They shook. Young Mr. Vanton exhibited no air of
triumph. Instead, he seemed actually dejected. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
two, as by common consent, took the homeward path.
Tommy burst out: &#8220;You licked me fair and square.
I&mdash;I&#8217;d like to be friends. I&mdash;I guess you&#8217;re all right.
Mermaid&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Tommy stopped. For the first time it struck full
upon him that though he had done all that lay in him to
settle matters and settle them right, matters, at any
rate the all-important matter, remained much as they
were before.</p>

<p>Mr. Vanton broke in: &#8220;I want to be friends, too. We
ought to be, hadn&#8217;t we, after this?&#8221;</p>

<p>A point bothered Mr. Lupton. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t made
me take back what I said about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Looking down at the ground Mr. Vanton flushed and
said: &#8220;Oh, well, you didn&#8217;t mean it. It&mdash;it&#8217;s not important
I&#8217;m not a foreigner, you know. I was born
in San Francisco. I keep dropping into French. You
just poke me when I do it. And about&mdash;her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
Mr. Vanton broke off, seeming to find the exact words
difficult. Then he went on: &#8220;You see, it isn&#8217;t anything.
She likes to hear me talk about France and San Francisco
and she&#8217;s learning a little French. And&mdash;there&#8217;s
nothing to it, except that I don&#8217;t know any one here and
she&#8217;s company.&#8221;</p>

<p>A doubt deep in Mr. Lupton found expression. &#8220;I
s&#8217;pose she won&#8217;t want anything to do with me after
this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> won&#8217;t tell her,&#8221; asserted the other boy. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
hesitated, then said: &#8220;Tommy, you know she thinks an
awful lot of you. And, anyway, she&#8217;s got to decide
for herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>To this mature and final view old, young Mr. Lupton
assented. &#8220;Of <i>course</i>! I guess it&#8217;s not how we feel
about her, but how <i>she</i> feels. Well, I don&#8217;t care if I do,&#8221;
concluded Mr. Lupton, recklessly, taking one of Mr.
Vanton&#8217;s cigarettes. He lit it, finding the flavour much
unlike a pipe of cornsilk. It was not his, however, to
pronounce the taste inferior in the face of the world&#8217;s
judgment. Tommy puffed and felt a strange sense of elevation.
&#8220;That was a dandy fight you put up,&#8221; he conceded.
&#8220;Say, where did you get all that stuff? Will you
show me how?&#8221; Mr. Vanton agreed. &#8220;I&#8217;ve forgotten a
lot,&#8221; he confessed. &#8220;I used to have a Japanese wrestler
when I was a kid in San Francisco, and later I had some
lessons in Paris.&#8221; Mr. Lupton had ceased to listen,
however. The curing of Turkish tobacco was suddenly
distasteful to him. After a while he apologized: &#8220;You
pretty well knocked me out,&#8221; and managed an admirable
smile. They walked back to Blue Port together
and Tommy did not even wince at an allusion
by the shy-eyed Mr. Vanton to the fact that Mr. Vanton
had a longing to become a writer some day. &#8220;I scribble
a lot now. I even write verse,&#8221; explained Mr. Vanton,
his innocent brown eyes glancing for a moment into
Tommy&#8217;s more worldly blue ones. Tommy did not
smile or shout. His allegiance to the new friendship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
was complete and unequivocal; and besides, there was
coming into his mind a recognition of certain impalpable
things which a girl always fell for and which he, Tommy
Lupton, had not to offer. Travel, a foreign language,
manners that were polite without being stuck-up, an
ability to talk, and a gift of expression; a sort of good
looks, too, in spite of the snub nose and the pallor;
sophistication extending to the consumption of Turkish
cigarettes; and a knack of writing poetry. Tommy,
who ached not a little, felt a spiritual depression. What
had he to offer Mermaid in comparison with these endowments?
He had a good spirit, however; he was a
sport and quite ready to exclaim, &#8220;May the best man
win!&#8221; And Guy had won in a fair fight, and he and
Guy were friends.</p>

<p>A feeling that school was intolerable crept over young
Mr. Lupton. He longed to be with his father at the
Coast Guard Station on the beach where, in the fortunate
event of a shipwreck, he might alone and single-handed
save life.</p>

<p>None of these thoughts seemed to fill the mind of
Guy Vanton, who was talking desultorily about San
Francisco and Telegraph Hill and the Presidio and the
Mission; Paris, boating on the Seine, and streets with
meaningless French names. The two boys parted in
front of the Vanton house, guarded by tall evergreens, a
ship stranded in a forest of Christmas trees. To and
fro on the veranda, walking with short steps and heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
tread, paced Captain Vanton, a mysterious Santa Claus
wearing enormous sidewhiskers.</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>The way in which Richard Hand senior came to go to
Keturah Smiley for money was this: The affairs of the
Blue Port Bivalve Company, though generally prosperous,
required, at certain seasons, ready money. And
despite his $20,000, now considerably grown, Richard
Hand could not always put his fingers on it. He had
little use for banks. He paid doctor&#8217;s bills for babies
at about eight per cent., equipped young married
couples at as high as sixteen per cent.&mdash;for had they not
the rest of their lives to pay it off in?&mdash;and buried
people at an average rate of twelve per cent. This was
good business.</p>

<p>He had got all Blue Port under his thumb except
Keturah Smiley. It irked him to see walking along
Main Street the tall, stiff figure of the only woman
who had ever turned him down on a business proposition.
He would go over, speculatively, the character,
disposition, and probable fortune of his lost sister-in-law.</p>

<p>She owned a good deal of land. Richard Hand did
not love land, but this was good land, in one large tract,
reaching from the South Country Road to the bay.
The larger part was high ground, partly wooded.
Through the centre of it flowed Hawkins Creek. Summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
cottages, the creek being dredged as a boat basin,
or, with a spur of track, a factory site?</p>

<p>When he saw Keturah Smiley he explained, with a
good deal of tiresome detail, the affairs of the Blue
Port Bivalve Company.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t put a cent in it,&#8221; Keturah told him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t ask you to. I don&#8217;t ask you to,&#8221; Mr. Hand
explained, soothingly. &#8220;I know how women feel about
such things. &#8217;Tirely right, too, &#8217;tirely right. But
it&#8217;s a good company and in good shape. Only we
need money in hand to lease more oyster beds to
p&#8217;vide for expanding business. Just $5,000 would set
us right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Five thousand shucks! I wouldn&#8217;t trust you with
five cents!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, maybe you&#8217;d trust Horace Hollaby. I&#8217;ll
pledge the leases with him as security.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keturah thought it over. There could be no question
of Judge Hollaby&#8217;s honesty. A $5,000 mortgage
coming due in six months was certain to be paid.
Meantime, the bank would let her have the money.
There would be no profit in it, of course, but curiously
enough, for once she was not thinking of that. She was
thinking of an interview many years ago, and of how
she would love to hurt this man.</p>

<p>A desire to pay him off surprised and dominated her.
She did not see in the least how it was to be done, but if
it was to be done this entrance into business relations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
with him was necessary and would constitute, in some
way not now clear, the first step.</p>

<p>&#8220;You take the leases up to Judge Hollaby. I&#8217;ll go
over them with him, and if they&#8217;re all right you go to
him and get the money,&#8221; she directed.</p>

<p>And then she thought&mdash;hard.</p>


<h3>XI</h3>

<p>Keturah Smiley was no fool. When the leases of the
oyster beds were made out they were made out in her
name, and the Blue Port Bivalve Company had exactly
nothing to do with the transaction. Judge Hollaby,
purely in his capacity as Miss Smiley&#8217;s lawyer, attended
to the matter. Purely as Miss Smiley&#8217;s lawyer he
attended to the details of a loan of $5,000 by Miss
Smiley to Richard Hand. Solely as a man, an oldish
fellow who had seen a good deal of human nature and
knew both parties in the case, he wondered what
would happen next.</p>

<p>He had not long to wait. The oyster beds were not
extensive, but they were the richest in that part of the
Great South Bay. Keturah Smiley, deserting Judge
Hollaby for the first time in her life, went to a Patchogue
lawyer and formed with him the Luscious Oyster
Corporation.</p>

<p>The Luscious Oyster Corporation took over the leases
of the oyster beds held by Keturah Smiley and took
an option on a large part of the Smiley land. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Patchogue lawyer held that indiscretion was sometimes
the better part of valour. He was very, very indiscreet;
he was deliberately and extensively indiscreet.
And the world that cared about Blue Port oysters soon
knew all the plans and purposes of the Luscious Oyster
Corporation.</p>

<p>It would build a large factory on Hawkins Creek.
Arrangements for special railway trackage were being
made. There was plenty of capital back of the new
corporation. It had the rights to a new and hitherto
unannounced process for making several first-class products
from oyster shells. Its oysters, the best, the fattest,
the most succulent in all the Great South Bay, would
be shipped, opened, in sanitary containers with a distinctive
label and carried in refrigerator cars. The shells
would be turned over to the factory where, aside from
certain novelties and trinkets and toys, vast numbers of
them would be used in the composition of a new kind of
cement for floors in office buildings and for roofing.</p>

<p>This cement was superior to anything yet discovered
for these two purposes, and possibly for others&mdash;experimentation
with it was still going on. As a roofing
it was clean, smooth, of an attractive dull white finish
which could be tinted to any desired shade. It was
absolutely tight and waterproof and noiseless! The
hardest shower, striking upon it, was inaudible. As a
flooring the cement had all these advantages and
several others besides. It could be flushed with water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
and if wiped only partly dry would dry quickly by
atmospheric absorption. Footsteps could hardly be
heard upon it. If left white it reflected artificial light
and enhanced the illumination of the room; moreover,
it was, because of its whiteness, next to impossible to
lose anything upon it. Tinted, it matched any rug or
floor covering. And it was tremendously durable.
Prolonged tests with hard substances scuffing continuously
over a sample of the cement had not worn
away the surface perceptibly, but should it wear away,
the texture of the cement was uniform throughout. The
worn spot would look exactly like the rest of the floor.</p>

<p>No stock was for sale.</p>

<p>This last announcement filled with incredulity the
dismayed Richard Hand, reading the newspapers and
gnashing his teeth which were not so well preserved as
Keturah Smiley&#8217;s. There must be stock for sale!
There always was, in a thing like this. What was the
use of all this puffing if it was not to unload stock on
unsuspecting purchasers? Still, this piece of canniness
did not help Mr. Hand along mentally. <i>He</i> didn&#8217;t
want the worthless stock. He wanted those oyster
beds; and most particularly he wanted this talk about
the Luscious Oyster Corporation, its plans, its purposes,
its enterprise, and its prospective glory stopped&mdash;absolutely
stopped. It was hurting the business of the
Blue Port Bivalve Company, and if unchecked would
hurt it still more.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>He went to see Keturah.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unfair?&#8221; snapped Miss Smiley, answering Mr.
Hand&#8217;s principal accusation. &#8220;When did you ever
take up the little problems of fairness, Dick Hand?
Besides, I have nothing to do with it. I am not the
Luscious Oyster Corporation, and sha&#8217;n&#8217;t be. I&#8217;ve
merely sub-leased some oyster beds to them and given
them an option on a piece of land. Go see Mr. Brown.
He&#8217;s doing the talking.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went to the door with him. &#8220;Mind you&#8217;re
ready with that money when it&#8217;s due,&#8221; she admonished
him.</p>

<p>Mr. Hand was ready neither with money not a retort.
He repaired to the office of Mr. Brown, the Patchogue
lawyer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely true, every word of it, Mr. Hand,&#8221;
said Lucius Brown, bringing his right fist against
the palm of his left hand. &#8220;Ab-so-lute-ly true! No
stock for sale. Patents all right. Samples over
there on the desk. Tests whenever you&#8217;d like to see
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care for your samples and tests,&#8221; snarled old
Mr. Hand, showing how bad his teeth were. &#8220;What
do you want to quit this nonsense?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; inquired the younger man,
suddenly grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much money?&#8221; shouted Richard Hand, his
fingers closing and unclosing. He trembled with rage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
The face of the other man suddenly assumed a dark and
menacing expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this a bribe, Mr. Hand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Call it what you like. I want you should shet up,&#8221;
answered the caller, doggedly. &#8220;Only question is, how
much will you take to shet up this fool&#8217;s talk?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Brown&#8217;s face mirrored mixed emotions.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re making a serious mistake, Mr. Hand, when
you address me that way,&#8221; he informed the miser.
&#8220;You are badly advised when you talk about paying
me money to &#8216;shet up.&#8217; If you want to make a business
proposition to buy the leases of oyster beds held
by the Luscious Oyster Corporation and our option on
Miss Smiley&#8217;s land, I am here to receive it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Richard Hand reflected. His crafty glance travelled
out of the window and across the street. As if she were
there precisely to focus his thoughts at this moment,
Keturah Smiley, with Mermaid beside her, walked
along the opposite side of the thoroughfare bent on some
enterprise of shopping. She was very straight, as
usual; her shoulders, thrown squarely back, were inexpressibly
odious in the sight of the drooping Mr.
Hand. Even more odious was the relaxation of her
severe face as she turned to answer some question the
girl beside her had been asking. Mr. Hand made up
his mind quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want none o&#8217; your patents nor samples nor
stock,&#8221; he declared in a surly and savage tone. &#8220;I&#8217;ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
buy those leases of you for just what they cost me&mdash;$5,000.&#8221;
A thought stunned him. Then he raised
his voice almost to a scream.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;what am I buying back my own
property for? Them leases is mine. It&#8217;s a swindle!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Brown seemed interested. A thin foam appeared
on Richard Hand&#8217;s lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;I borrowed $5,000 from Keturah Smiley to lease
those beds,&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;That fool Hollaby makes
out the leases in her name. Makes out a note for
ninety days for $5,000, my note, and gives it t&#8217; her.
Hands me the money and I pay for the leases. I&mdash;why,
I <i>own</i> those leases. Give &#8217;em back, you robber,
give &#8217;em back!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Moderate your language or I&#8217;ll throw you out of
here and down the stairs,&#8221; Lucius Brown advised the
old man. &#8220;Don&#8217;t talk robbery or swindling in this
office. Now see here, let&#8217;s see just what this is. You
borrowed $5,000 of Miss Smiley to lease these beds.
But the leases were made out in her name. Well, then,
man, everything depends upon your understanding
with Keturah Smiley. Can&#8217;t you see that there are
two separate transactions? Can&#8217;t you see that it was
no concern of hers what you did with $5,000 she lent
you? The owners of those beds got their money.
And you got $5,000 on your personal note. Did
Judge Hollaby conceal from you the fact that the
leases were being made out to Miss Smiley?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>&#8220;No,&#8221; groaned Richard Hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then there&#8217;s nothing more to say,&#8221; finished the
lawyer. &#8220;You put yourself in her hands. Has she
broken faith? Did she ever promise you in word or
writing any money or other valuable consideration for
those leases? No? Was there any verbal understanding
with you respecting them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told her I&#8217;d pledge &#8217;em with Judge Hollaby, but
when they were drawn she insisted they be made out
to her,&#8221; Mr. Hand explained. He was dazed. &#8220;She
threatened to back out at the last moment. She&mdash;she
didn&#8217;t exactly promise anything. She said they must
be leased to her. She said she&#8217;d lend me $5,000 on my
note of hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As nearly as I can make out,&#8221; observed Lucius
Brown, &#8220;Miss Smiley talked little and made no engagements.
You can&#8217;t prove anything by what she
said, and you can&#8217;t prove anything by what she thought.
You might succeed in proving your own lack of brains;
in fact, you have satisfied me that you haven&#8217;t any.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Hand said no more. With a look of actual
agony on his face he turned and drooped away in the
direction of the door. But with the tenacity of a
drowning man&mdash;drowning in grief, rage, mortification,
and dismay&mdash;he clutched at a straw. Pausing at the
doorway of the lawyer&#8217;s office he took a half step back.</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;now&mdash;there&#8217;s that option on the Smiley
tract,&#8221; he stammered. &#8220;I might buy that. I&#8217;ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
been thinking for a long time of buying a likely piece
of land. How long&#8217;s that option for, and how much
would you want for it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Brown considered. &#8220;Twenty thousand dollars,&#8221;
he said, finally. Mr. Hand, recoiling, sneered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty thousand! Nonsense! Why, the land itself
ain&#8217;t worth more&#8217;n ten. I&#8217;d be buying it twice
over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it seems to be a passion with you to buy things
twice over,&#8221; said the lawyer, reflectively. &#8220;It&#8217;s an
option to buy only, and must be exercised in six months,
otherwise it is forfeit. But you must consider that in
buying this option you practically do away with the
Luscious Oyster Corporation. All our plans are predicated
upon dredging Blue Port oysters from a few
beds and preparing and shipping them from this nearest
available site, working up the shells for commercial
purposes. If you buy our option we cannot go on.
There is no other site, and there are no other beds except
the free beds, unsuitably located for our purpose
and yielding inferior oysters. You might as well buy
our capital stock, patent rights, and everything, lock,
stock, and barrel, as buy that option. Naturally we
have to ask a high price for it, even if we only paid
$1,000 to get it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You figure your assets, outside the option, at
$19,000,&#8221; deduced Richard Hand. &#8220;Option, $1,000;
leases of beds, $5,000; patents and prospects and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
lawyer&#8217;s fees&#8221;&mdash;here he sneered&mdash;&#8220;$14,000. I&#8217;m to pay
you $20,000 and then pay Keturah Smiley $5,000 more
for part of that $20,000 worth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See here, Mr. Hand,&#8221; said the lawyer, earnestly.
He changed his tone to one of warning persuasion. &#8220;I
have no doubt that when the time comes Miss Smiley
will refuse to take any money on that note for $5,000,
preferring to keep the lease of the oyster beds. Mr.
Hand,&#8221; and Lucius Brown&#8217;s voice had a ring in it,
&#8220;this is a dead serious proposition. The Luscious
Oyster Corporation, which honours me by misspelling
my first name, is no joke. Everything that I have
said about it can be substantiated and will be.
Every prediction I have made will be verified. What
that will mean to the Blue Port Bivalve Company and
to you personally I can&#8217;t say, because I don&#8217;t know and
I don&#8217;t care. But this much I do know: if you buy
anything from us you will not pay too high a price for
it, and you will pay for it only once. What you don&#8217;t
buy you will go without. We purpose to go ahead with
our plans and do not expect to be molested; but if you
are looking for a fight you can get it right here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Richard Hand was facing a man younger than himself,
of greater intelligence and better education, a man
trained in the law who presumably knew exactly what
he could do, and when and how&mdash;and how much. There
was no knowing what was behind him. It might be one
of the banks, Richard Hand reflected. It might be (a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
shudder) rich New Yorkers; capitalists that you read
about. The young man named no names, but this
only enhanced the dread stirring in Richard Hand&#8217;s
mind. The unknown is fearful.</p>

<p>If the Luscious Oyster Corporation once got started
it very likely spelled the ruin of the Blue Port Bivalve
Company. It would break the monopoly he had so carefully
and laboriously built up, take away from him the
little czardom he had created, and leave him a poor man.</p>

<p>But $20,000! He was worth, now, more than that.
Not so <i>much</i> more, though. It would take away from
him exactly the sum with which he had started operations
in Blue Port; it would put him back where he
had been then. He would have enough left to keep him
out of the poorhouse.... Either that or a life&mdash;and&mdash;death
grapple, with the loss of every cent he had!</p>

<p>There was a sort of mist before his eyes as he stood
in Lucius Brown&#8217;s office. He had never been so terrified
in his life. A pain that had arisen in the back of his
head troubled him. He seemed to be on fire, all aching;
and the next moment he was cold, his head swam, and he
felt near to nausea. Gradually every other feeling but
the one of fear left him&mdash;fear and physical pain. His
mind, as distinguished from the head that contained it,
was numb. He could not think. He heard himself
saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll buy. I&#8217;ll buy. I&#8217;ll buy&mdash;everything. Only I
must have my note back. Keturah Smiley must give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
me my note back.&#8221; He began to whimper like a little
child. &#8220;My note, give me back my note! It&#8217;s $5,000.
Five&mdash;thousand&mdash;dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucius Brown turned away in a sort of pity, which
was for the man&#8217;s physical distress only.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in to-morrow and I will have things ready for
you,&#8221; he said, sitting down at his desk and leaving his
caller to get out as well as he might.</p>

<p>And so it came about that Richard Hand, as president
of the Blue Port Bivalve Company, signed a contract
whereby the Blue Port Bivalve Company bought
the capital stock of the Luscious Oyster Corporation,
with all rights, leases, options, patents, etc., etc., held
by the said corporation; in consideration whereof the
company aforesaid agreed to pay and deliver to the
said corporation the sum of $20,000&mdash;of which $1,000
was payable in cash on the signing of the contract, and
the remaining $19,000 was payable in instalments as
thereinafter set forth.</p>

<p>With a copy of this agreement, Lucius Brown handed
to Richard Hand the note for $5,000. In the street
Richard Hand suddenly stopped, pulled this note from
his pocket, and with frenzied fingers tore it to shreds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn you!&#8221; he sobbed.</p>


<h3>XII</h3>

<p>The relation of Keturah Smiley to the events in
Lucius Brown&#8217;s office was fairly simple; at least, she and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Mr. Brown seemed to find it so. They met later in the
day. Miss Smiley was unaccompanied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now about this money,&#8221; she said, in her most decided
tones. &#8220;Most of it must go to Hosea Hand. It
will be the sum Dick Hand withheld from him, with
interest at 6 per cent. for more&#8217;n a quarter of a century.
If Hosea knows where it came from he won&#8217;t take it,&#8221;
she told Mr. Brown with a grin. &#8220;Fix it up. Left
him by a cousin several thousand dollars removed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take the $1,000 for the option on my land and
run the risk Dick Hand&#8217;ll exercise it. He hasn&#8217;t enough
money left for <i>that</i>. How much do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Brown, without affecting embarrassment, named
a fee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too little,&#8221; Keturah commented. &#8220;I have, besides
the money for the option, $5,000 for the leases, the
money I lent that old fox. That&#8217;s $6,000. I figure
it&#8217;ll take $12,000 to set Hosea right. That leaves
$2,000. Take it. You deserve all of it. I&#8217;m not saying
you don&#8217;t deserve more. It&#8217;s worth that to me to
take the hair and some of the hide off that man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About the patents, Miss Smiley?&#8221; Lucius Brown
suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not forgetting them,&#8221; answered Keturah.
&#8220;But they didn&#8217;t cost me anything and I don&#8217;t want
anything for them. I once fed and housed a crazy
inventor&mdash;that is, he was crazy some ways but his
inventions seem to be all right. He left &#8217;em to me for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
his keep and out of gratitude, maybe. Anyway, I&#8217;ve
had &#8217;em, along with other odds and ends, these many
years. I saw enough to convince me that they were
worth something; so did you. Just how much I don&#8217;t
know; I was never one to monkey with those things.
But it won&#8217;t hurt Richard Hand to part with a few
thousands for them. They&#8217;re all in good shape and
order. If he goes ahead and makes a mint o&#8217; money
with them I&#8217;ll be sorry!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t the necessary capital,&#8221; said Brown.</p>

<p>&#8220;And he can&#8217;t get it,&#8221; finished Miss Smiley. &#8220;And
he has no more nerve than a hen crossing the road. It
takes a young man to do those things. Some day that
boy of his might make something out of them&mdash;if he&#8217;s
got any stuff in him besides the Hand meanness!&#8221; she
concluded, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m so generous with Dick Hand,&#8221;
she continued, after a moment. &#8220;Twelve thousand
dollars of this money represents an accumulated sum
unrighteously withheld from his brother. Two thousand
dollars represents your fee. That&#8217;s fourteen
thousand&mdash;and for it he is getting patents that may be
worth ten times that. But we had to give him something,&#8221;
she said, half humorously. &#8220;I wish I had a
little less conscience so&#8217;s to use him as he&#8217;s used others!&#8221;</p>

<p>A knock sounded on the door. Mr. Brown called out,
&#8220;Come in,&#8221; and Mermaid entered. She wore a dark
green tailored suit, and her skirts had lengthened. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
abundant coppery red hair had been &#8220;put up,&#8221; and she
looked an astonishingly mature young lady. The three
freckles remained in place and the dimples had deepened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Keturah,&#8221; she said, using a new form of
address, &#8220;time to go home! Dickie Hand is outside
waiting for me. Have you heard the news? His
father told Dickie and his mother that he&#8217;d broken a
tooth and lost all his money. Must have been his
wisdom tooth,&#8221; surmised the girl as Miss Smiley rose to
go with her.</p>


<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>When Hosea Hand, otherwise and generally Ho Ha,
learned through a visit from Lucius Brown that $12,000
had been left him by a cousin he was astounded, happy,
and perplexed. For some time he did nothing but treat
his friends and acquaintances. He bought Mermaid
countless ice cream sodas and Mr. Brown countless
cigars, and various others a considerable number of
drinks (always taking a cigar himself). Occasionally
he got confused in his happiness, as when he asked Mermaid
to have a cigar and Lawyer Brown whether he
wanted lemon or orange phosphate. His perplexity
arose over the cousin whose beneficiary he had so unexpectedly
become. Mr. Brown seemed unable to
make this end of the wonder suitably clear.</p>

<p>&#8220;A fourth or fifth cousin, Hosea,&#8221; said the lawyer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
carelessly, over the substitute for the phosphate. &#8220;She&mdash;he&mdash;they&mdash;I
mean, it&mdash;was someone you never knew.
She&mdash;they&mdash;had a lot of money. Remembered all the
relatives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, father and mother both came of large families,&#8221;
observed Ho Ha. &#8220;I must have had a couple
dozen cousins. I can&#8217;t remember who was fourth and
who was fifth among &#8217;em. I don&#8217;t know&mdash;would you
think I might show my appreciation by putting up a
nice tombstone to this cousin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Lord, certainly not! I mean&mdash;I&#8217;m sure there
will be a suitable memorial,&#8221; replied Mr. Brown,
slightly choking over the near-phosphate as his mind
imaged a tall shaft in honour of Keturah Smiley.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was the name?&#8221; asked Ho Ha.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ke&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began the lawyer, thoughtlessly, caught
himself in time, and changed the syllable to the similitude
of a sneeze. &#8220;Ke-chew! Ke-chew!&#8221; He sneezed
again, as though an encore might confer verisimilitude.
Ho Ha did not appear to suspect the sneeze.</p>

<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose that cussed brother of mine got a share,&#8221;
Ho Ha meditated aloud. &#8220;The wonder is he didn&#8217;t get
mine, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mermaid mixed her drinks recklessly, following a
pineapple ice cream soda with a raspberry. It was
before the day of the more fanciful concoctions or Mermaid
would have had a week of sundaes.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do, Uncle Ho?&#8221; she inquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
with the interest that, from a young woman, is always so
flattering to a man, even an uncle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I guess I&#8217;ll build a little shack on the beach and
put the rest in the bank,&#8221; Ho Ha told her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean what are you going to do with the
money, but what are you going to do with yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hosea twinkled. &#8220;P&#8217;raps I&#8217;ll marry,&#8221; he hinted.
&#8220;Now if I was only a young man&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He looked at
her roguishly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s never too late to marry,&#8221; Mermaid said, between
spoonfuls. &#8220;But if you&#8217;re going to marry you
won&#8217;t want a shack on the beach&mdash;or your wife won&#8217;t,
which amounts to the same thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ho Ha nodded repeatedly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to marry
the first woman that proposes to me,&#8221; he announced
with his most sagacious air. &#8220;I might advertise,
eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>They strolled down the street together until they
reached Keturah Smiley&#8217;s. Mermaid commanded her
uncle to enter. Keturah was making a batch of cookies
in the kitchen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in, Hosea,&#8221; she said, cordially. &#8220;Child, if
Dickie Hand comes here this evening, do for goodness&#8217;
sake make the boy eat yesterday&#8217;s crullers so we can
have a taste of these cookies ourselves. I declare,
Hosea, I don&#8217;t know what my own cake tastes like any
longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; said Ho Ha, looking at her attentively.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>&#8220;Have one,&#8221; said Keturah, slightly flustered by the
look he gave her. Could he have learned anything?
Ho Ha fell silent a moment, and then after several
mouthfuls said: &#8220;You were always a great hand for
relationships, Keturah. Can you tell me who this
cousin was that&#8217;s left me some money?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Smiley faced away from him and began energetically
stowing her batch in a cake box.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Hosea,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I never
could keep track of your relations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe this cousin was a relation,&#8221; said Ha
Ha. &#8220;I never heard of any relations except poor relations.
Most likely this was some conscience-stricken
person, repenting of evil gains&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; exclaimed Miss Smiley with an emphasis
and a touch of indignation that seemed unnecessary.
&#8220;She had as clear a conscience as some others,
I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, so &#8217;twas a woman?&#8221; observed Ho Ha, innocently.
&#8220;Well, now, that&#8217;s funny. I can&#8217;t think of any
<i>woman</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say &#8217;twas a woman,&#8221; parried Keturah.
&#8220;She or he or whoever it was probably had more than
she&mdash;he&mdash;knew what to do with. Left to the next of
kin. It&#8217;s a common thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncommon common,&#8221; agreed Ho Ha somewhat
paradoxically. &#8220;Happens every day. You read about
it in the newspapers. I dare say she, he, or it got the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
idea while lining the pantry shelves with &#8217;em. What&#8217;s
money for, anyway, Keturah?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Money,&#8221; interjected Mermaid, &#8220;is to make those
who haven&#8217;t it want it and those who have it want
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Money,&#8221; said Miss Smiley, sententiously, &#8220;is to
hang on to until you know when to let go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Money,&#8221; Ho Ha framed his own definition, &#8220;is only
to make some other things more valuable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, Uncle Ho,&#8221; Mermaid conceded. &#8220;If
Dickie Hand&#8217;s father&mdash;your brother&mdash;didn&#8217;t have as
much money as he has, Dickie would be worth almost
nothing to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Child!&#8221; Keturah rebuked her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Aunt Keturah, I don&#8217;t mean that I value
Dickie for his father&#8217;s money,&#8221; explained Mermaid,
impatiently, &#8220;but don&#8217;t you see if his father were poor
Dickie would be so&mdash;so <i>unmanageable</i>. I shouldn&#8217;t be
able to do a <i>thing</i> with him! But his father&#8217;s rather
rich, even if he did lose a lot of money a while ago, and I
can just make Dickie behave himself by telling him
that he can&#8217;t possibly get any credit for what he makes
of himself because there&#8217;s all that money to help him.
That makes Dickie simply wild, and he says he&#8217;ll be
somebody in spite of his father and his money. He
gets almost desperate&mdash;which is quite necessary,&#8221; she
added, thoughtfully. &#8220;The other day he said, &#8216;Damn
my father&#8217;s money! I&#8217;ll show you it hasn&#8217;t anything to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
do with <i>me</i>!&#8217; Of course I gave him the&mdash;the dickens
but I couldn&#8217;t help being rather pleased.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Smiley regarded Mermaid with great sternness,
but Ho Ha&#8217;s shoulders seemed to move queerly. Finally
he choked.</p>

<p>&#8220;If my cooking chokes you, Hosea, you&#8217;d better not
eat it,&#8221; Keturah said with considerable dignity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, Keturah,&#8221; was the humble reply.</p>

<p>Mermaid had been eyeing the two as if a surprising
notion had just occurred to her. Now she slipped on a
jacket and started to leave the house, &#8220;I have to see
Dickie,&#8221; she explained to Miss Smiley, &#8220;and get him
mad enough so he&#8217;ll study to-night and pass his chemistry
examination to-morrow.&#8221; She slipped out.</p>

<p>Left alone, the man and the woman said nothing for a
while. Miss Smiley found various supper preparations
to occupy her. Ho Ha watched her with the air of a
person who wanted to say something but found it difficult
to choose the right words. At length, &#8220;Keturah,&#8221;
he got out, &#8220;do you remember a time when money made
trouble between us?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Smiley did not answer him. She did not look
at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you do,&#8221; Ho Ha resumed, undisturbed,
apparently, by the silence. &#8220;Now what I would like to
know is whether the thing that made us trouble can&#8217;t be
made to mend it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Still she did not answer nor appear to heed him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>&#8220;I know very well,&#8221; said Ho Ha, as if to the furniture,
and nodding at the grandfather&#8217;s clock which stood at
one end of the large living room, &#8220;I know well that my
fourth cousin or fifth cousin or whoever it was that left
me this money left it to me because it belonged to me.
I suspect Cousin What&#8217;s-the-Name <i>got</i> the money because
it belonged to me, and got it from the person who
owed it to me expressly to put in my hands. I&#8217;m
obliged to Cousin Who&#8217;s-This as much for trying to do
the right thing as for getting me the money. And I
feel, somehow, that Cousin You-Can-Guess-Whom
thought less about the money than about something
else. A cousinly sort of a cousin, but real cousins don&#8217;t
act that way. Real cousins let each other fend for
themselves. But, anyway, that&#8217;s no matter, one way
or t&#8217;other. The main thing is to set things right. The
money was only good to show something else that was
worth a good deal more than the money&mdash;and that was
a good feeling. A&mdash;a <i>strong</i> and <i>enduring</i> feeling,&#8221;
emphasized Ho Ha. &#8220;A feeling that&#8217;s there&#8217;s only one
word for, and the word doesn&#8217;t express it. Keturah,&#8221;
he exclaimed, getting up and approaching the woman
who kept her back so persistently toward him, &#8220;you and
I aren&#8217;t young any longer. We&mdash;we were cheated out
of something, or else we cheated ourselves out of something,
and it was a good deal. But, Keturah, it isn&#8217;t
all gone. We didn&#8217;t lose everything. We made a
mistake, a terrible mistake, but it was only a mistake;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
it wasn&#8217;t an &#8217;ntentional wrong either of us did the other.
Keturah, can&#8217;t&mdash;can&#8217;t we just salvage some happiness
out of the wreckage?&#8221; He was standing close to her
now.</p>

<p>Suddenly he put his arm awkwardly and eagerly about
her. She had raised her hands to her face, and as she
took them away he could see she was crying....</p>

<p>Out of doors, Mermaid, without any definite knowledge
of what was going on inside, strained her diplomacy
to the utmost to keep young Mr. Hand from entering
the yard and passing the living-room windows
and even, like as not, entering in quest of food to sustain
his strength until supper. Dickie was a tall, thin,
light-haired boy with a blond skin of singular freshness
and brown eyes of singular alterations. Just now they
showed a puzzled impatience with Mermaid&#8217;s whims.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you go to the dance with me this evening?&#8221; he
demanded.</p>

<p>Mermaid shook her head. &#8220;I want you to walk up
street with me,&#8221; she announced.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221; interrogated the young man. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
just come from there, and you say you don&#8217;t want
anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want a serious talk with you,&#8221; corrected Mermaid.
&#8220;How would you prepare H<sup>2</sup>SO<sup>4</sup>, Dickie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hang chemistry!&#8221; ejaculated Mr. Hand. &#8220;Wait
a moment till I get a cookie.&#8221; He started into the
yard. Mermaid made a short dash and checked him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>&#8220;Nothing but yesterday&#8217;s crullers,&#8221; she stated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, a cruller, then,&#8221; grumbled Dickie.</p>

<p>Mermaid plucked at his sleeve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dick Hand,&#8221; she informed him, &#8220;you must not
go in that house, now. Aunt Keturah has a&mdash;a
caller.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh. I don&#8217;t suppose he&#8217;ll bite me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I will,&#8221; the exasperated young woman retorted.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll not speak to you or go to a party with
you, if you don&#8217;t come along this minute!&#8221; Then a
purely feminine inspiration seized her. &#8220;Do as you
like,&#8221; she said, with excellent indifference, &#8220;I daresay I
can get Guy Vanton or Tommy&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Leaving the sentence unfinished, she controlled
herself with an effort and half turned away. Dickie
forgot the need of sustenance. Intolerable feelings
prompted the young man to fall in at her side. Together
they marched solemnly northward. Said Mr.
Hand: &#8220;Say, Mermaid, I&mdash;it&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&mdash;we&mdash;him. Yes, Dickie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash;don&#8217;t you think we might become engaged?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;I suppose we might, some day, Dickie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-day. I&#8217;m going on eighteen and you&#8217;re sixteen.
Lots of people are engaged for years&mdash;as long as three
years. I&#8217;d be twenty-one and you nineteen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Dickie; when you&#8217;re twenty-one, I&#8217;ll be nineteen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Mermaid, don&#8217;t you&mdash;don&#8217;t you <i>care</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>&#8220;If it would help you pass that chemistry exam, I&#8217;d
become engaged to you right away, Dickie,&#8221; sighed
Mermaid. &#8220;Of course I care. If you flunk that you
can&#8217;t enter technical school or anywhere else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, <i>damn</i> the chemistry!&#8221; roared Mr. Hand.
&#8220;Exam, Damn!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a short poem; remarkable poem,&#8221; Mermaid
commented with some coldness. &#8220;Full of&mdash;full of
emotion. Conforms to Wordsworth&#8217;s definition of
poetry, &#8216;emotion recollected in tranquillity.&#8217; But
you&#8217;re not tranquil enough, Dickie. I don&#8217;t think I
want to be engaged to any one who swears regularly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beg your pardon, &#8217;m sure,&#8221; Mr. Hand mumbled,
sulkily. &#8220;I won&#8217;t say it again. Go on, don&#8217;t mind
me! Go on, go with Tommy. He&#8217;s almost twenty.
Or <i>Mister</i> Vanton, who is twenty-two. <i>I&#8217;m</i> only about
eighteen.&#8221; He pulled out a pack of cigarettes and said
loftily: &#8220;If you don&#8217;t mind.&#8221; Lifting his cap, he inclined
his head and moved away.</p>

<p>Mermaid looked after him uneasily. Suddenly she
called out, &#8220;Dickie!&#8221;</p>

<p>He returned, but with a certain effect of distant
politeness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come over after supper and I&#8217;ll quiz you on the
chemistry best I can,&#8221; she offered.</p>

<p>He relaxed somewhat. &#8220;All right,&#8221; he agreed,
magnanimously. &#8220;I&#8217;ll walk back with you,&#8221; he went
on, as if uttering an after-thought.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>Mermaid acquiesced. As they entered the yard they
met Ho Ha coming out of the house. He stopped,
looking at them happily and mysteriously, and propounded
a riddle to Mermaid.</p>

<p>&#8220;If an uncle of yours,&#8221; he said, &#8220;were to marry
your aunt, what relation would that make your uncle&#8217;s
nephew to your aunt&#8217;s niece?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Friends once removed,&#8221; said Mermaid. &#8220;Oh,
Uncle Ho, I&#8217;m tickled to death!&#8221;</p>


<h3>XIV</h3>

<p>At sixteen Mermaid was not adequately to be described
by Longfellow&#8217;s lines about the maiden</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Standing with reluctant feet</div>
<div class="verse">Where the brook and river meet.</div>
</div></div>

<p>She was, without doubt, a girl still, despite her height
of five feet two inches, despite the coiled beauty of her
coppery hair and the wise young glance of her blue eyes.
The three freckles about her nose, the dimples when she
smiled, the faint colour in her cheeks, and the slender
straightness of her body were wholly girlish; so was her
general attitude toward older people. It was only when
she was with certain boys slightly her seniors that a
sort of womanliness seemed her predominant quality.
The nature of this grown-up atmosphere varied. With
Guy Vanton, who was twenty-two, Mermaid would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
have appeared to most onlookers to be rather sisterly.
With Tommy Lupton, who was twenty, she was simply
an attractive young person of the other sex. But in her
attitude toward seventeen-to-eighteen-year-old Richard
Hand the girl alternated the rôle of comrade and equal
with that of motherly management. These variations
were not a matter of ages but of personalities. They
were determined by the fact that Guy Vanton, from a
lonely boyhood, was developing into a lonely young
man; that Tommy Lupton was perfectly normal and a
healthy youth who was Mermaid&#8217;s senior by an interval
which, between a boy and a girl or a man and a
woman, is without significance; by the further fact
that Dickie Hand needed special treatment and looking
after.</p>

<p>For Dickie was a gifted boy who was always on a
seesaw. He had his ups and downs of which his grasping
old father was but seldom aware, and could have
viewed with nothing but contempt. Nor was Dickie
likely to get much good of his mother&#8217;s philosophy. All
her life Mrs. Hand had supposed that everything was for
the best; and this opiate of age is no drug to feed to
youth. Dickie, whose spirits were either aloft in the
air or bumping the ground, could not play seesaw alone.
Mermaid recognized as much and seated herself on the
other end of the plank. Occasionally Dickie would
forget the equilibrium necessary and would make more
or less horizontal advances toward her. To restore the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
balance Mermaid had to meet him halfway, but she
seized the first opportunity to remind him that his place
was at a distance.</p>

<p>At sixteen Mermaid was halfway through High
School at Patchogue. The question of her future remained
undecided. Cap&#8217;n Smiley, her Dad, and his
sister, Keturah, quarrelled mildly about it. The
keeper of the Lone Cove Coast Guard Station did not
like the notion of losing sight of his adopted daughter
except for holidays. Keturah thought the girl ought
to go away to school.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be a fool, John,&#8221; she counselled the keeper.
&#8220;The child will be home two months or more in summer.
You won&#8217;t be on duty on the beach then, and we can all
four&mdash;you and she and Hosea and myself&mdash;be together.
She&#8217;s got to have something in her life besides Blue
Port, and she&#8217;s got to have something in her life
besides those three boys. They&#8217;re all right as boys
go,&#8221; she added in qualification, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t suppose
you want her to stay here and spend her life as your
daughter and my niece, the Vanton boy&#8217;s sister,
Tommy Lupton&#8217;s sweetheart, and Dickie Hand&#8217;s
mother!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems to me, Keturah,&#8221; interjected her new husband,
Ho Ha, &#8220;being all those things would be considerable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t anything to be somebody,&#8221; his wife answered.
&#8220;On the other hand, there&#8217;s a lot of tomfoolery in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
talk of &#8216;doing&#8217; this and that. There&#8217;s no sense in doing
anything unless it&#8217;s going to enable you to be somebody,
and there&#8217;s no sense in being somebody unless it enables
you to do something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on, hold on,&#8221; protested Ho Ha. &#8220;You go too
fast for me to follow you. I didn&#8217;t marry you for your
philosophy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you have to take my philosophy along with
the rest,&#8221; said Keturah, briskly. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t marry you
to bake pancakes every morning of my life, but I guess
I&#8217;ll have to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of philosophy in pancakes,&#8221; asserted
Ho Ha. &#8220;They go flip-flop, and that&#8217;s the way life
goes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why these people who can turn somersaults
gracefully always get along well, eh?&#8221; said Cap&#8217;n
Smiley with a grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;To stick to the subject and not to the griddle,&#8221; resumed
Keturah, &#8220;the child ought to go away this fall.
She likes chemistry and she likes cooking and she mixes
all sorts of messes in both. I live in constant dread
that she&#8217;ll serve me some good-tasting poison by accident
or that the baked potatoes will explode. I don&#8217;t
know anything about this scientific cookery you hear
so much about, but Mermaid might as well get what
there is in it. They say the way to a man&#8217;s heart is
through his stomach, though I must say that the job
of filling his stomach is about all a woman could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
expected to handle.&#8221; She looked at Ho Ha, a notable
eater.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, I think she might spend this summer on
the beach with me&mdash;with all of us,&#8221; amended Cap&#8217;n
Smiley. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be there anyway this year. You and
Hosea and Mermaid can take the Biggles house, or
something more sizable if you want; there&#8217;s plenty of
little houses within a quarter of a mile of the station.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mermaid, entering, had heard her Dad&#8217;s suggestion
and clapped her hands in applause.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll be splendid!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Captain Vanton
has taken a little bungalow, and Guy is going to be over
there; Tommy Lupton and Dickie Hand are going to
spend August camping on the beach; so we&#8217;ll have company
all summer!&#8221;</p>

<p>The three adults exchanged amused glances.</p>


<h3>XV</h3>

<p>Any girl of sixteen fond of chemistry and cooking can
have a first-rate time on the Great South Beach in summer.
Any girl of sixteen companioned by from one to
three youths slightly older than herself, and of nicely
differentiated ages and temperaments, can have a good
time in summer anywhere. Mermaid was as happy on
the beach as if she had been born there as, indeed, for all
practical purposes, she had. She was not &#8220;as happy as
if she had lived there all her life,&#8221; because no one can be
happy in a place that has not gained some charm by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
contrast with other places. The girl collected shells
and sea creatures, drifting from chemistry into biology
and back again; she analyzed sea weed and admired it;
she divided with Keturah Smiley the labour of cooking
meals to which the salt air gave inimitable savour; she
boated, she swam, waded, tramped the dunes, and sunned
herself on the sands. She read everything from the
habits of jellyfish to the loves of Maurice Hewlett&#8217;s
heroes and heroines, moving against mediæval backgrounds
as rich and varied as the scenes in old tapestries.
She flirted; and once she found herself in a game
of hearts.</p>

<p>Twenty-two-year-old Guy Vanton, rather short,
snub-nosed, with black hair and attractive eyes, had
gone into the surf with her and, with the ignorance of
those unacquainted with that shore, had ventured too
far out. The huge curl of a breaker caught him, for a
southeast wind was blowing and the ocean was beginning
to show whitecaps. Guy was struck on the shoulder
by the full force of the falling wave, knocked down,
buried, washed about, and dragged out as the tons of
water flung upon the sloping sand shingle receded
with a baffled roar. Mermaid, higher up on the slope,
saw him fall. She breasted the water and, as the
bottom sank away from under her feet, struck out,
swimming.</p>

<p>Diving head first through the next huge sea she lifted
her head and caught sight of Guy struggling a few yards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
away. She got up to him just as another breaker, a
colossal wall of a dark glassiness, towered for a second
above them and then toppled down with a noise like
Niagara. Mermaid forced herself and Guy beneath the
water, which carried them some distance up the beach,
and just then he began to clutch her with the grip of one
drowning. She broke his hold and, half swimming,
tugging with all her might, got him to a place where she
could touch bottom. Then she worked forward until
she stood, partly supporting him, in a boiling sea
waist high. She was nearly exhausted when she finally
dragged him up on the beach beyond the wash of the
sea. It happened that there was no one near by; evidently
they had not been observed from higher up on
the shore, so Mermaid began the task of resuscitation.
Fortunately Guy Vanton opened his eyes almost immediately
under her wearied ministrations.</p>

<p>He did not say anything as he gradually recovered
himself. The two sat beside each other on the empty
beach. Mermaid, shivering, had thrown sweaters
about herself and Guy. At length young Vanton
turned and looked in her eyes with the curious, shy,
wild-animal look that everyone noticed in his own. At
the same time he seized her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mermaid, you saved my life&mdash;<i>my</i> life.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke in wonder, as if there were something inexplicable
about it. Mermaid smiled at him, white and
tired and anxious.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>&#8220;You&#8217;re all right, Guy?&#8221;</p>

<p>His fingers tightened on her hand. There was something
steady in the fire of his look.</p>

<p>&#8220;I owe you so much,&#8221; he said, brokenly. &#8220;Almost
everything. You were my first friend. Five years
ago. I&mdash;I&#8217;ve never been able to make it up to you, and
now I never shall. I&#8217;ve&mdash;I&#8217;ve loved you all this time.
I&mdash;won&#8217;t you let me kiss you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The last words were perhaps laughable, but something
that was not a drop of salt water from his black
hair rolled down his cheek. Mermaid&#8217;s own eyes
glistened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course&mdash;this once, Guy,&#8221; she murmured. His
lips brushed her wet cheek. She rose to her feet a little
unsteadily and reaching down her arm half pulled him
to his. &#8220;They&#8217;ll be frightened if we don&#8217;t get back
soon,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;You&mdash;you mustn&#8217;t put your
arm about me, Guy. Can you walk all right? See
here, I&#8217;ll put my arm about you.&#8221; She was matter-of-fact.
They went unhurriedly along the shore to
where a boardwalk at the edge of the dunes led to the
house Captain Vanton had rented for the summer.
There they parted, with the appearance of unconcern.
Keturah Hand met Mermaid at the door of their
cottage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Child, is it necessary for you to hug that Vanton boy
publicly?&#8221; she inquired. Mermaid explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you bring him to?&#8221; asked her aunt.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>&#8220;I kissed him. Now, Aunt Keturah, it&#8217;s all right.
There was nobody around and he doesn&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>


<h3>XVI</h3>

<p>Tommy Lupton was a great, tall, strapping youth
with everything indeterminate about him, from the
colour of his hair and eyes to his behaviour. He had no
visible ambitions beyond becoming a bayman like his
father and ultimately a surfman in one of the Coast
Guard Stations on the beach, preferably the one at
Lone Cove where John Smiley was keeper and his
father a member of the crew. Since the day, some
years earlier, when Guy Vanton had thrown Tommy
around in a pine-needled clearing in the woods about
Blue Port, Tommy and Guy had been good friends,
so far as too utterly unlike young men can be fast
friends. Neither fully understood the other. Mermaid,
who liked them both, had constantly to be explaining
Guy to Tommy and interpreting Tommy to
Guy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tommy likes you but thinks he ought not to,&#8221; she
told Guy. &#8220;Tommy is the sort of boy that thinks he
ought not to like anybody unless he can admire him, too.
If Tommy&#8217;s best friend were running against&mdash;oh, well,
say Colonel Roosevelt&mdash;for some office, Tommy would
vote for Roosevelt. You see, he&#8217;d <i>admire</i> Roosevelt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a principle,&#8221; elucidated Guy.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s unreasonable,&#8221; elucidated Mermaid.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>&#8220;It is better than just voting for a man because he&#8217;s
a friend of yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. But to have to admire a person in order
to like him comfortably is just like&mdash;like a boy!&#8221; exclaimed
the young lady. &#8220;Like a <i>little</i> boy,&#8221; she
added.</p>

<p>To the hero-worshipping Tommy she had something
else to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll never see how much there is in Guy Vanton
if you keep looking for what isn&#8217;t there,&#8221; she admonished
him. Tommy looked at her, cloudily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it takes a girl to see what there is in him,&#8221;
he surmised, jealously. &#8220;You&mdash;I don&#8217;t suppose Guy
sees anything in me. I guess you don&#8217;t, either. I
guess there isn&#8217;t anything much in me,&#8221; went on poor
young Mr. Lupton, pathetically. &#8220;I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t ever
amount to a lot. I&#8217;ve never been anywhere, and I
can&#8217;t jabber French, and I never wrote poetry except on
a valentine. I hate school and I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m through
with it. And I&#8217;d rather be a Coast Guard than write
a book, as Guy&#8217;s doing, or become a great chemical
engineer, as you say Dickie may some day. I&#8217;ll never
be rich and I&#8217;ll never be famous, and you can&#8217;t make me
either.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mermaid was building things in the sand. She
brushed her hands and looked at him with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to make you anything, Tommy,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;Go on and be a Coast Guard. My Dad&#8217;s a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Coast Guard. Your father&#8217;s a Coast Guard. Being a
Coast Guard is just as good as anything else and better
than most. It all depends upon the <i>man</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m a man,&#8221; avowed Mr. Lupton. &#8220;And,
anyway, you say that now, but after you&#8217;ve been away
at school and all that you&#8217;ll look down on me. You
won&#8217;t want anything to do with me, much. You won&#8217;t
want me around. And I won&#8217;t <i>be</i> around,&#8221; he concluded.
Mermaid looked at him, briefly, and then
glanced away. A slight uneasiness beset her. It was
justified when Tommy suddenly reached over for her
hand, taking it roughly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mermaid,&#8221; he said. He stopped, and then went on,
stammering a little: &#8220;You&mdash;you must know I love
you&mdash;like everything,&#8221; he finished, helplessly. &#8220;You&mdash;of
course I can&#8217;t expect you feel the same way&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mermaid, much disturbed, cut in: &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t,
Tommy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You oughtn&#8217;t to interrupt like that.&#8221; Mr. Lupton&#8217;s
voice was boyishly irritated. &#8220;You&mdash;you wouldn&#8217;t
interrupt Guy Vanton! I can&#8217;t expect you to listen to
me, I suppose. Maybe I haven&#8217;t any right to speak.&#8221;
He was immediately astonishingly grown-up again.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to hear me&mdash;at least, I hope you&#8217;ll hear
me,&#8221; he went on, imploringly. &#8220;I told you you
couldn&#8217;t make anything of me but you could help me
make something of myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>A sixteen-year-old girl, listening to such words, can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
hardly be blamed for a slight sense of self-importance.
It is part of a girl&#8217;s education, or ought to be. Perhaps
not at sixteen; but Mermaid had already experienced
the self-importance that comes from handling rather
risky material, even though it was only inert powder or
colourless acid. This was one of those situations where
there is no danger if the substances are not brought near
to a spark. She therefore dampened her sympathy
before mixing it with Tommy&#8217;s unreserve. She felt
self-importance, but she did not abate her caution.
More than one explosion in the laboratory had taught
her humility. It is fair to say that she was not consciously
experimenting and she was not heartless when
she answered the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to help you make something of yourself,
Tommy. I don&#8217;t want to make anything of
anybody except <i>my</i>self. I&#8217;ll have all I can do, maybe,
to do that,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;I&mdash;I like you, and
that&#8217;s all. No, it isn&#8217;t; I&#8217;ll let you alone. There&mdash;that&#8217;s
a good deal, isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s supposed to be, from a
girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Tommy was in no condition to jest. He picked
himself up, unhappily, from the sand. For a moment
Mermaid&#8217;s mind ran back curiously to the story that,
as a very little girl, she had heard her Uncle Ho tell of
his boyhood. Nightly, through the pane of a little
attic window high up in the hills of the middle of Long
Island, he had seen the flash of the Fire Island Lighthouse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
many miles distant, a beacon inviting the youngster
to adventures in the great world whose shores it
guarded. Mermaid, who was imaginative, had often
re-lived those childish hours in the dark attic invaded
by the beckoning ray. As she stood up now, gathering
up her sweater and one or two books from the beach, it
came home to her that Tommy Lupton, who was twenty,
would never undergo such an experience. Poor Tommy
was not imaginative; for him no beacon flamed anywhere;
his whole idea of life was work well-performed, a
wife and children (probably), and a comfortable home to
visit in his hours off duty. And once, if fortune brought
it about, once in a long lifetime of work and play and
peacefulness, an heroic moment, one deed worthy of
admiration, a single act of bravery or courage or devotion
that would show the stuff that was in him&mdash;all
the rest would be background. If the moment never
came that would not matter. The only thing that mattered
was to be ready for it if it should come.</p>

<p>Whereas Mermaid must be forever seeking moments
and doing her part, when she was ready, to create them.
There was a profound difference. Tommy stood on
guard, his back to the rock; she would be advancing&mdash;retreating,
too, sometimes, no doubt&mdash;but constantly
gaining ground. There was young Dickie Hand with
his unquestionable gifts; he would go forward, and go
far if&mdash;if&mdash;he had the right incentive. And Guy Vanton....
Mermaid paused with a pang. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
process of definition it struck upon her for the first time
that Guy would neither go forward like herself or Dickie
Hand nor stand steadfast like Tommy; he would shrink
back. He would conduct a well-covered withdrawal,
a leisurely, unobtrusive withdrawal; and it would be a
retreat!</p>

<p>The pang was caused by the knowledge that of the
three she most nearly loved Guy.</p>


<h3>XVII</h3>

<p>The summer spent itself with no further eventfulness
except in the matter of ghosts.</p>

<p>Many people, perhaps most, do not believe in ghosts,
but Mermaid did and so did her Dad. Uncle Ho was
well acquainted with the principal ghosts peopling the
beach. Keturah Hand ridiculed the idea of their existence.
In general, those who had lived on the beach
for any length of time were believers or of open mind;
those whose visits to the beach had been confined chiefly
to all-day picnics thought the legends nonsense.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Kidd,&#8221; stated Keturah, &#8220;may have buried
a chest of treasure in the bald-headed dune with the
very steep slope. I know my father used to tell of
people digging there to recover it. Kidd was certainly
round about here in the <i>Quedagh Merchant</i> or the
<i>Antonio</i>; and everybody knows that he stopped at
Gardiner&#8217;s Island and got supplies and presented Mrs.
Gardiner with a bolt of&mdash;calico, wasn&#8217;t it? If he buried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
a chest in that dune over there, he, or his crew, certainly
may have killed a gigantic negro, spilling his blood over
the chest so that his wraith would guard the treasure.
I think it likely that the crew did it. Seamen are always
so superstitious.&#8221; Here she looked pointedly at
her husband, an ex-sailor. &#8220;Hosea here, just because
they used to cut a cross in the mast to bring a fair wind,
started carving the bedpost the other day so the wind
would blow from the southwest instead of the north.
Kidd was, or had been, too much of a gentleman to
entertain such low ideas; and if his crew killed the negro
and spilled his blood I fancy he washed his hands
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of the blood?&#8221; interpolated Ho Ha, innocently.
His wife looked at him sharply and, without answering,
went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;But when it comes to that negro&#8217;s spirit guarding
the treasure, and when it comes to dark, swarthy Spanish
ghosts with rings in their ears; and drowned sailors
in flapping dungaree trousers, and ghosts of old sea
captains, lost passengers, and Heaven knows who else,
I, for one, don&#8217;t take the least stock in them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe in the Duneswoman, Aunt Keturah?&#8221;
inquired Mermaid.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not in a Dunesman, nor in the Dunes children,
unless you mean those eighteen children of old Jacob
Biggles that were named after wrecks and ragged as
ghosts,&#8221; Mrs. Hand retorted.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>&#8220;But, Aunt, I&#8217;ve seen the Duneswoman,&#8221; protested
Mermaid. &#8220;So has Dad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All you&#8217;ve seen is a face and an arm,&#8221; corrected
Mrs. Hand. &#8220;And I can&#8217;t find any one else who has
seen as much as that. A face and an arm are not a
ghost. They&#8217;re a&mdash;I don&#8217;t know what,&#8221; she finished.</p>

<p>&#8220;A hallucination,&#8221; Mermaid offered.</p>

<p>&#8220;A hallelujah. That&#8217;s what you say when you see
one. You say &#8216;Hallelujah!&#8217;&#8221; came from Ho Ha.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I see one I may say something even more
remarkable,&#8221; his wife responded, grimly.</p>

<p>It was several nights later when she awoke and
uttered a long-drawn scream of terror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hosea!&#8221; she cried, clutching her pillow. &#8220;Hosea,
there&#8217;s someone at the window!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ho Ha leaped up manfully, went to the window,
stuck his head through the netting which was tacked on
as a screen, and drew it in again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense, Keturah,&#8221; he said, gently. &#8220;No one in
sight except Captain Vanton standing on the dune in
front of his house.&#8221; The Vanton cottage was a dune
away, but a valley lay between. &#8220;You&mdash;why, you must
have seen a ghost. Oh, ho-ho-ho!&#8221;</p>

<p>He communicated the nature of the disturbance to
Mermaid in the next room, and when Cap&#8217;n Smiley, who
slept at the station, came over for breakfast next morning,
there was some chaffing about the ghost Keturah
had seen.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>&#8220;I certainly saw something,&#8221; said Mrs. Hand, emphatically.
&#8220;And if it was a ghost it was the ghost of a
live man. It had sidewhiskers exactly like Captain
Vanton! You all know he prowls around at night.
There&#8217;s something mighty queer about it; but then,
everything about that man is queer. When it comes
to his looking in my bedroom window, though, I think
I shall do something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, pshaw, Keturah,&#8221; said her brother. &#8220;Vanton
may be a peculiar fellow, but it&#8217;s not likely he walks by
your windows. At two in the morning, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to think I have nothing he might covet,
John, but I have a few trinkets that anybody would set
a value to!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that why you hugged your pillow?&#8221; inquired her
husband, innocently. Keturah gave a little jump and
looked about her nervously, a performance entirely
contrary to her nature. As if she realized that she had
betrayed herself she said, finally: &#8220;Well, I wasn&#8217;t going
to say anything about it but I did bring my stones over
here. I felt it wasn&#8217;t safe to leave &#8217;em in Blue Port, and
of course I sleep with &#8217;em under my head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stones?&#8221; exclaimed Mermaid in mystification.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean jewels, do you, Aunt Keturah?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I mean jewels,&#8221; replied Mrs. Hand, with
some asperity. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never told you anything about
them&mdash;young people get their heads turned with such
things&mdash;but I have every one of the stones that belonged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
to my aunt, Keturah Hawkins, Captain Hawkins&#8217;s wife;
and I also have the stones that belong in settings in the
curios and things in our parlour. There&#8217;s quite a lot
of them, and if I weren&#8217;t used to a hard pillow I daresay
I&#8217;d not be able to sleep a wink.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Aunt, may I see them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you may, though it&#8217;s a lot of trouble to
get them out. It&#8217;s risky, too, for some of the littler
ones might roll away and get lost,&#8221; commented Mrs.
Hand.</p>

<p>After breakfast she brought out her pillow and exposed
the contents to the two men and the girl. John
Smiley had seen the jewels, though not for many years.
Ho Ha knew of their existence, but had never seen them
and had supposed them secreted in Blue Port. To
Mermaid their very existence was a revelation, and their
beauty a greater one.</p>

<p>All kinds of jewels seemed to be represented, and
there were also Eastern stones which none of the four
could name. Sapphires were especially abundant, very
large ones, of darkest blue. They had been Keturah
Hawkins&#8217;s favourites, but Mermaid worshipped the
emeralds which she knew she could have worn in her
hair, and the diamonds which would have been no more
brilliant than her blue eyes. There were wonderful
pearls which needed to be worn to regain their finest
lustre, and there were rubies of as dark a hue as the
blood that must have been shed for them. The majority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
of the gems were loose; the pearls were roped,
however, and there were a few bracelets and other simple
ornaments. All the settings were old and Eastern,
suggestive of bare arms and bare necks&mdash;bare ankles,
too. At least one of the ornaments was an anklet, they
conjectured. Where Captain Hawkins had got them
Keturah Hand was unable to say. He had, she supposed,
picked them up at various times and in many
places. He had visited, in his career, every port from
Bombay to Tientsin; Ceylon, Madagascar, and South
Africa; Peru he had touched at more than once. And
he had sometimes done business by barter.</p>

<p>After they had admired the jewels Keturah, with
Mermaid&#8217;s help, checked them off on a list she had and
restored them to their hiding place.</p>

<p>The next night, after they had spent the day on the
bay in Cap&#8217;n Smiley&#8217;s small sailboat, pillow and all were
gone.</p>


<h3>XVIII</h3>

<p>The loss of the jewels affected Keturah Hand
strangely. At first it made her ill, but soon she was not
only well, but better than she had been for a long time.
She declared herself actually relieved, in a sense, to be
rid of the stones. They had been a constant worriment
for years. Now she did not have the care and anxiety
of them&mdash;and she knew they were in safe hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any one who steals them is going to take pretty good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
care of them,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;And I think I know who
stole them, and why.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it the ghost of one of Kidd&#8217;s pirates?&#8221; asked
Mermaid, upon whom the theft of the jewels had seemed
to have a more persistently depressing effect than it had
had upon her aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;He may have been one of Kidd&#8217;s pirates in a previous
incarnation, and he may have been Kidd himself
in an earlier life,&#8221; responded Keturah. &#8220;At present
he&#8217;s a retired sea captain whose story wouldn&#8217;t look
pretty in print, I suspect. Not that it will ever get
printed,&#8221; she added. &#8220;He took them because&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
She broke off. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know as I&#8217;m called upon to
air my guesses,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;I&#8217;m not a detective in
a detective story and I&#8217;ll not do any deducing out loud.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both Ho Ha and John Smiley were much upset by the
disappearance of the stones, though both felt called
upon to remonstrate with Keturah when she said, quite
calmly, that Captain Vanton had got what he was after.</p>

<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s the slightest shred of evidence that Captain
Vanton took them, Hosea and I can handle him,&#8221;
her brother told her. &#8220;You won&#8217;t let the theft be
known, and you won&#8217;t hire a detective. You won&#8217;t tell
us anything that points to Vanton.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I can&#8217;t,&#8221; cut in Keturah. &#8220;I&#8217;m not like
a good many women. I don&#8217;t mistake my intuitions
for evidence. I just <i>feel</i> that he has them&mdash;and I don&#8217;t
much care if he has. I also feel that he won&#8217;t break them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
up and sell them, and that eventually they will get
where they belong, as nearly as possible. Jewels aren&#8217;t
like any other kind of property, and everybody who has
much to do with them knows it. I&#8217;m not superstitious,
but you don&#8217;t have to be superstitious to believe that a
sort of curse attends the possession of most really valuable
gems whenever they&#8217;re not in the right hands.
They don&#8217;t rightly belong to me, never did. As I say,
it&#8217;s no use to hand down jewels like other property.
My aunt, to whom they belonged as rightfully as any
one else, had no more sense than to leave them to me
along with her land and furniture. I&#8217;ve always known
they weren&#8217;t for me, but what could I do about it?
Nothing, except wait for them to get into the right
hands or throw them in the bay. Maybe they&#8217;ve got
into the right hands now. If they haven&#8217;t, they&#8217;ll make
whoever&#8217;s got &#8217;em trouble enough until they do. If
they belong to him it won&#8217;t matter how he came by
them, or whether he deserves &#8217;em, or whether he is a
good man or a devil; but if they don&#8217;t belong in his
hands, he may be a living saint and still be sorrier than
the worst sinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ho Ha and Cap&#8217;n Smiley affected to treat this argument
as foolishness, but something in it appealed to the
mysticism in Mermaid. It fitted in with what she had
observed of the illogicality of life, and she was readier
than many an older person to believe that the world is
ruled as much by sentiment as by law, and that life is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
series of compromises only for those who can&#8217;t accept
its contradictions, and go on with their work.</p>

<p>She expressed this view to Guy Vanton without
mentioning the loss of the stones.</p>

<p>It was Mermaid&#8217;s last day on the beach. In a week
she would be in New York, taking special courses at
Columbia and perhaps elsewhere. She was going in
for cooking and chemistry, the chemistry of foods, and
later she might take some medical courses leading to a
study of the chemistry of digestion.</p>

<p>&#8220;The chemistry of the human body,&#8221; she said to Guy,
&#8220;is a job for the next fifty years.&#8221;</p>

<p>Guy considered, lazily. &#8220;If you like it, I suppose,&#8221;
he said, reflectively. &#8220;I wish I knew enough chemistry
to analyze my father, for instance. Not his digestion,
which is perfect, but his mind. But I think the best
approach to the mind is still alchemy. The philosopher&#8217;s
stone probably exists, only we&#8217;ve always been on
the wrong track in hunting it. It would be an idea that
would transmute base-mindedness to rare-mindedness,
and not base metals to gold. My father needs that
kind of a philosopher&#8217;s stone; perhaps I do, too. We&#8217;re
very unlike, you know; often it seems to me as if he
weren&#8217;t my father at all. Sometimes I think he hates
me, but even if he did&mdash;there are ties hate can&#8217;t break.&#8221;
His voice lowered and his queer eyes looked into the distance.
&#8220;Some day,&#8221; he said, &#8220;some day, Mermaid,
I&#8217;ll tell you, maybe&mdash;&mdash; You pulled me out once, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
know.&#8221; He looked at her with a painful appeal. His
eyes were those of a wild fawn. An almost overpowering
desire to answer that appeal swept through the girl,
met the solid wall of her final doubt of him, and was
broken to pieces. She gave his hand a friendly squeeze.
&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; she said, and left him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">PART THREE</h2></div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">IN THE room, besides the people, there was a coffin
and a black flag decorated with the skull and crossbones
of buccaneers&mdash;or fictioneers. Every once
in a while persons went down a ladder to a dim, smoky
room where heads bumped the ceiling and where casks
and kegs and straw-covered wine bottles stood and
hung about in an ornamental sort of way. Mediterranean-looking
servitors went to and fro in the subterranean
crypt or chamber with great mugs of ginger ale.
Visitors usually bent over the large, dark table in the
centre whereon lay a carefully executed map&mdash;the map
of &#8220;Treasure Island.&#8221; The men wore their hair long,
the women wore theirs bobbed. Candles, the only
light, threw grotesque shadows. Occasionally a waiter
sang, &#8220;Pour, oh, pour the pirate sherry&#8221; from &#8220;The
Pirates of Penzance&#8221; or &#8220;Yo-ho-ho! and a bottle of
rum.&#8221; Somewhere in obscure darkness a parrot
squawked. The sounds were favourably construed into
cries of &#8220;Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mermaid, otherwise Mary Smiley, wore coiled upon
her head such a magnificence of dark, red-gold hair as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
make her the target of envious glances from cropped
young women all about her. Of these looks she seemed
completely unaware, but they excited the amusement of
her companion. Dick Hand did not fit in with the
general Bohemian scheme of the place. He was in
Greenwich Village but not of it. His proper environment
was a certain office much farther down town in
New York, on Broadway a little above Bowling Green.
There, in the region of tall buildings at once rigid and
supple and perfectly self-possessed as only skyscrapers
can be, Dick worked by day. By night he pleasured
about town. He was by no means addicted to the
Pirates&#8217; Den, nor to the Purple Pup, nor Polly&#8217;s, but
Mermaid, in her last year of special study at Columbia,
had expressed a desire to visit&mdash;or, rather, revisit&mdash;the
Village. So they had come down on a bus to Washington
Square and then fared along afoot. Mermaid had
been expressing her satisfaction with the evening.</p>

<p>&#8220;How badly they do this sort of thing here,&#8221; she said,
glancing again about her. &#8220;You and I, Dickie,
wouldn&#8217;t be so unoriginal, I hope!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dickie, who had no instinct in these matters, asked,
&#8220;Are they unoriginal?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221; She smiled at him and two tiny shadows
marked the dimples in her cheeks. &#8220;They have simply
no ideas. Don&#8217;t you see how religiously they have
copied all the traditional stuff and accepted all the
traditional ideas of what a pirates&#8217; den ought to be?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
A real pirates&#8217; den was never like this. Pirates lived in
a ship&#8217;s fo&#8217;c&#8217;s&#8217;le or, on occasion, in a cave; or they went
glitteringly along a white beach such as we have at
home across the bay from Blue Port. They did not
live in a litter of empty casks; an empty bottle was only
good to heave overboard unless you had occasion to
break it over a comrade&#8217;s head. Pirates never had a
skillfully executed chart. Usually they had no chart
at all; only certain sailing directions and a cross bearing.
Robert Louis Stevenson, writing &#8216;Treasure Island,&#8217;
burlesqued an ancient, if not very honourable, profession.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never thought about it,&#8221; responded Dick, carelessly.
&#8220;You may be right. But what do <i>you</i> know
about pirates, anyway. Where do you get all this
stuff?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are just as many pirates as ever there were,&#8221;
asserted the young woman. &#8220;There&#8217;s Captain Vanton
out home. He is a typical pirate. The pirates who
visited the Great South Beach at one time or another
are still there, off and on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, say, Mermaid. You don&#8217;t really believe in
ghosts, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have to believe in them, Dickie, I have
seen them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the beach, home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the beach, home, and here in New York, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What were they?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>&#8220;Just people, Dickie. I don&#8217;t pretend they were
flesh and blood. I don&#8217;t pretend they ever spoke to
me or looked at me. They looked through me, sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Mermaid, you know it&#8217;s silly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Dickie, I know it&#8217;s not.&#8221;</p>

<p>Young Hand finished his ginger ale and made a face
at the mug. Then he asked: &#8220;Well, how do you account
for &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I got to account for them, Dickie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean, why can&#8217;t I see them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know you can&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t prove anything&mdash;it doesn&#8217;t prove you
never will. Dick, see here, go back to your mathematics.
There&#8217;s the fourth dimension. All we can
see and feel has only three dimensions&mdash;length, breadth,
and thickness or height&mdash;but mathematics tells you
things may exist which measure four ways instead of
three.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t see &#8217;em; neither can you or anybody
else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. But you can see representations of
them. A house on paper is not a house, but a picture
of one. A ghost may only be a representation, a sort of
picture, a projection of Something or Somebody that
measures four ways. A house measures three ways
and you can put it, after a fashion, on a sheet of paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
where it measures only two ways. Why can&#8217;t a ghost
be a three-dimensional&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tommy Lupton never saw a ghost,&#8221; interrupted
Dick, with a smile. &#8220;Can you picture Tommy patrolling
the beach at night as a dutiful Coast Guard
and coming upon a projection of Captain Kidd?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. Tommy is extremely likely to meet
Captain Vanton,&#8221; said Mermaid, promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that Captain Vanton is Captain Kidd
living on earth again?&#8221; jested the young man.</p>

<p>&#8220;A reincarnation? No. He might be the shadow of
Captain Kidd, though. He might be the three-dimensional
shadow of a four-dimensional creature.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come off! You said awhile ago that you didn&#8217;t
pretend the ghosts you saw were flesh and blood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Captain Vanton flesh and blood?&#8221; asked Mermaid.
&#8220;Did you ever pinch him or see him bleed?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dick stared at her with pain and disapproval.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mermaid, what a crazy thing to suggest! And
how&mdash;how confoundedly gruesome! Sounds like Poe.
We&#8217;ve been living with a spectre all these years out in
Blue Port. A spectre with an invalid wife nobody ever
sees. Seems to me Mrs. Vanton is more likely to be the
ghost. And a spectre with a son. <i>He&#8217;s</i> flesh and blood,
for Tommy Lupton once punched his head. Guy&#8217;s
flesh and blood, Mermaid.&#8221;</p>

<p>A colour overspread the young woman&#8217;s check. &#8220;I
know that,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>Then with a triumphant thought Hand exclaimed:
&#8220;Besides, lots of people have heard Captain Vanton
talk. What do you say to that? You said ghosts
didn&#8217;t talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said I had never had them speak to me,&#8221; she
corrected him. &#8220;I said they looked through you, and
not at you. Captain Vanton does not look at you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dick felt aggrieved. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d quibble,
Mermaid,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t like you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mermaid reached up and patted a coil of her hair.
Then she rested her cheek on that hand and, reaching
across the table, closed the other gently over
Dick&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not quibbling, Dickie,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;I
mean just what I say. Captain Vanton is a ghost to me
and that&#8217;s all about it. I don&#8217;t have to pretend. Once,
years ago, he came to see Aunt Keturah and I answered
the door. I don&#8217;t remember whether he looked at me
then or not. It doesn&#8217;t matter. If we can see ghosts,
ghosts can certainly see us. They can certainly speak
to us, too, if they wish; though whether we can speak to
them I&#8217;m not so sure. You&#8217;ve got the wrong idea entirely.</p>

<p>&#8220;A ghost is simply a person or thing that joins you
with the past, the unremembered or unrecorded or unknown
past. Somewhere, sometime, at some place, and
in some manner, Captain Vanton and I have met. I
don&#8217;t know it; I feel it. You&#8217;re a chemical engineer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
and I&#8217;m a chemist, too, of a sort. I&#8217;m getting into
chemico-therapy, the chemistry of the body, and
chemical agencies in healing. Now chemistry is all
right, in fact, it&#8217;s wonderful, but it doesn&#8217;t explain
everything and it never will. You may say that&#8217;s because
there&#8217;s a lot yet to be explored. There is, but
when it has all been dug up and tested, something will
still remain in the dark. The world will always have
its ghosts.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dick looked at her sympathetically. &#8220;If you were
any one else, Mermaid, I&#8217;d say you were nutty,&#8221; he
vouchsafed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll admit this place is enough to make a
person go plumb insane. Look at that coffin! And
look at these freaks about us!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mermaid smiled. By the flickering of the candles
he could see three freckles, the three he always remembered,
about her nose, rather high up, a decorative
arrangement to call attention, perhaps, to the brilliant
blue of her eyes. He was struck again with the sense
of her charm and unusualness. He had never met another
girl like her, and he knew he never would. There
couldn&#8217;t be, anywhere. What other girl, versed in exact
science, would argue earnestly for the existence of
ghosts? Dick knew that she meant what she was saying.
He thought to himself: &#8220;It&#8217;s only the difficulty of
getting it over to me. There aren&#8217;t the words, I suppose.
She&#8217;d always be two jumps ahead of you!&#8221;
Aloud he said: &#8220;Then your ghost may be someone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
else&#8217;s flesh and blood. Ghost&mdash;flesh&mdash;blood&mdash;coffin&mdash;skull
and crossbones&mdash;nightmare people. This is the
life!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mermaid laughed. There was a ring in her laugh of
complete surrender to mirth. A joyful surrender. She
said: &#8220;I am worried about Aunt Keturah. She hasn&#8217;t
been well. I&#8217;m going home as soon as college closes. I
don&#8217;t suppose I&#8217;ll see you again soon, Dickie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; said her companion. &#8220;Come West
with me&mdash;you and she&mdash;to San Francisco this summer.
I&#8217;ve a water purification job across the bay in Marin
County. It would do your aunt a lot of good to see
California. There&#8217;ll be days when I&#8217;ll have nothing to
do&mdash;waiting around while tests are going on and contracts
are being drawn. We could go to Palo Alto and
Monterey and Lake Tahoe. Perhaps farther.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mermaid considered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a particular wish to visit San Francisco,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;It has to do with ghosts. I&#8217;ll try to persuade
her, Dickie.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Hand was elated. They rose and went out into
the coolness of the springtime night. They walked, and
found themselves presently in Washington Square.
Something in the moment took Dick Hand by the
throat. In a shadowy lane, a little apart from the
benches of people, his words dulled by the rumble of
the Fifth Avenue omnibuses, he took Mermaid&#8217;s hand,
his fingers closing over it with intensity.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we&mdash;can&#8217;t we make it a honeymoon trip,
Mermaid?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>He could just see the slight movement of her silhouetted
head. She murmured: &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid not,
Dickie. I&mdash;I want to be very sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>He unclasped her hand slowly and they walked to one
of the green monsters, vain of their size and path and
importance, which take people uptown.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>College closed. Mermaid went home. She found
Keturah Hand in &#8220;poor health,&#8221; but a diagnosis of any
specific complaint seemed difficult.</p>

<p>&#8220;Old age and remorse, my girl,&#8221; her aunt assured
her. &#8220;Thinking of all the things I&#8217;ve done I might
better not have done, or have done differently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, any one can do that,&#8221; Mermaid answered. &#8220;I
looked for you to develop some interesting ailment,
Aunt Keturah, something new and original that I might
exercise my knowledge upon. I am now certified to be
competent to analyze you. I know all the diets. If
there is anything you&#8217;d like particularly to eat, don&#8217;t
eat it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You remind me of John Pogginson of Patchogue,&#8221;
protested Mrs. Hand. &#8220;An up-to-date doctor put
him on a diet some time ago. But instead of telling
John what he couldn&#8217;t eat he gave him a list of all the
things he could eat. There were eighty-seven of them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
and in the eighty-seven were things John Pogginson had
never heard of. He had a wonderful time. But his
wife almost died of indigestion. She said it wasn&#8217;t what
she ate, but seeing the things John could eat, that made
her ill.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two women sat down that night for what
Keturah called &#8220;a long talk.&#8221; Mrs. Hand wanted
first to discuss Mermaid&#8217;s plans; but Mermaid said
she hadn&#8217;t any.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks to you,&#8221; she told her aunt, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been able
to get what I wanted; but I confess I don&#8217;t know yet
what I want to do with it. I want to go to work, of
course, and I hope I can get into experimental work of
some kind. Perhaps at the Rockefeller Institute, perhaps
elsewhere. Chemicals won&#8217;t cure all the ills flesh
is heir to, but they will cure a lot more than we know
about. I don&#8217;t care about a career, that is, I don&#8217;t
care about making a world-startling discovery or
getting particularly rich or especially famous. I do
care about getting a reasonable amount of happiness
and satisfaction out of life; and that means being busy
at something congenial to you. And going ahead a
little in one direction or another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll marry,&#8221; said Mrs. Hand, abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so, too,&#8221; assented Mermaid. &#8220;If I can be so
fortunate as to find the right man, or if some man can be
fortunate enough to find me the right woman, or&mdash;well,
both. We&#8217;ve both got to find each other, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>&#8220;Children,&#8221; said Mrs. Hand, with condensation.</p>

<p>&#8220;The more the merrier.&#8221; Mermaid did not speak
lightly. Some deepening of her voice took all the flippancy
from the words.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have money, my money,&#8221; pursued Keturah
Hand. &#8220;Eventually; it goes to John first. He&#8217;s a
good brother to me and he&#8217;s been a good father to you,
as good as he could have been to his own flesh and blood.
You know the story?&#8221; she asked, with harsh suddenness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad has told me,&#8221; Mermaid replied, quietly. &#8220;It
is so many years ago that he has no thought but that
his wife and his own daughter are dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have something to answer for in that connection,&#8221;
her aunt said, and in spite of the harshness with which
she spoke, her voice trembled. &#8220;I made Mary Smiley,
that was Mary Rogers, very unhappy. I thought her
unfit to be John&#8217;s wife. I&mdash;I rubbed it into her that
she was unfit. Little, silly, childish, frivolous creature.
How much I am to blame for her running away with
her baby I don&#8217;t know&mdash;never shall, I suppose, until
the time comes to answer for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever you said to her, the facts remain,&#8221; the
girl commented. &#8220;Actions not only speak louder than
words, they talk the universal language. She ran
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think John felt that,&#8221; said Keturah. &#8220;He has a
strict sense of justice and she wronged it. It was the
child. That cut him to the heart, and no wonder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
After five years you were washed ashore. I&#8217;ve always
believed in miracles since that day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mermaid nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you study science, Aunt,&#8221; she said, confidingly,
&#8220;you come to believe in miracles as a matter of course.
That is, unless you have one of these impossible minds
that thinks a thing more wonderful than the explanation.
It&#8217;s the explanation of everything that&#8217;s really
miraculous. For instance, you used to scoff at Dad and
myself because we saw ghosts. There was the Duneswoman&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wrote me that it was an effect of phosphor&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
Mrs. Hand paused, helplessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Phosphorescence,&#8221; supplied Mermaid, &#8220;the wonderful
glow you see sometimes in sea water. It&#8217;s rare
as far north as this but very common in the tropics.
But to say it is an effect of phosphorescence doesn&#8217;t explain
it, except to the impossible, narrow little mind.
The real explanation lies in the mind of the person
seeing it. If it were just a peculiar phosphorescent
outline everybody should see it&mdash;everybody who was
around. Dad and I see it; the others don&#8217;t. Do you
know why?&#8221;</p>

<p>Keturah hesitated, then shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is something in common,&#8221; Mermaid told her.
&#8220;There is, or was, someone who knew us both, and who
becomes manifest to us both in that way. It&#8217;s like two
people seeing the same ghost. Why should the ghost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
appear in that way? I can&#8217;t tell you. Perhaps the
person was drowned. Why should the Duneswoman
appear to us at all? Perhaps to witness to something.
We may never discover what; and then again the day
may come when that vision will be the last impalpable
evidence necessary to make something clear. Then the
Duneswoman may make complete the explanation of a
surprising but perfectly ordinary set of facts; and the
explanation, and not the facts themselves, will make up
the miracle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess likely you&#8217;re right enough,&#8221; surmised Mrs.
Hand, &#8220;though I&#8217;m not sure I follow you all through.
I&#8217;m a matter-of-fact kind of a person. That&#8217;s why any
one like Captain Vanton gives me the creeps and gets on
my nerves so. I don&#8217;t know what he does to that
wife of his, or what he has done, but I don&#8217;t wonder we
never see anything of her. She must be a wreck,
living with that man. And he&#8217;s ruining that boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Guy?&#8221; asked Mermaid. A quick ear would have
caught the peculiar note in her voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guy goes around with a hang-dog look. He never
speaks to any one. He lives like a hermit, and his
father&#8217;ll make him as bad as himself,&#8221; stated Keturah,
with conviction.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go see him,&#8221; said the girl. Her voice was
deep and vibrant. &#8220;I must see his father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His father has got Aunt Keturah&#8217;s jewels,&#8221; announced
Mrs. Hand. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been sure of it ever since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the day they disappeared over to the beach. How he
knew about them I don&#8217;t pretend to say; but as he
followed Captain John Hawkins in the command of the
<i>China Castle</i> he must have come to knowledge of them
some way or other. Do you remember when you were
not more than eleven his coming to call here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never forgotten it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He said a Captain King was dead and that he had
killed him. He said this Captain King wouldn&#8217;t trouble
us any longer&mdash;your father and me. Your father remembered
then that one of the crew from the wreck of
the ship, the ship you were saved from, had talked of a
Captain King when he was dying and of a little girl that
must have been you. So we thought&mdash;your father
thought, anyway&mdash;that Captain Vanton might have
known something about you.&#8221; She reached over and
took Mermaid&#8217;s hand, awkwardly. &#8220;He went to see
him, but Captain Vanton couldn&#8217;t or wouldn&#8217;t tell him
anything.&#8221; Keturah paused and sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Vanton told Dickie Hand&#8217;s father about
the death of Captain King,&#8221; said Mermaid, surprising
her aunt. &#8220;Dickie once told me so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to know!&#8221; exclaimed Keturah. She was
silent for several moments in busy speculation.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you make of it all?&#8221; she asked, finally,
lifting her head. Mermaid, who had been looking
steadfastly at the wall, her hands clasped behind her
head, the whiteness of her arm gleaming against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
rich colouring of her hair, spoke without looking at her
aunt, without shifting her pose.</p>

<p>&#8220;I make something of it,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and I am
going to find out&mdash;something. I may not find out
the truth of it all, but I will at least find out if I am
wrong.&#8221;</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Captain Vanton looked much less like a ghost than a
man who had seen a ghost when Mermaid confronted
him in the mahogany and teakwood parlour. She had
with her a black bag, as if she were about to take a
journey. She seated herself easily and her manner was
composed, though her heart was beating rapidly. The
short, thick figure of the retired seaman moved back
and forth across the polished and whitened floor of the
room as it had moved across the whitened and polished
afterdeck of tall ships. His spreading sidewhiskers
with their misleading air of benevolence could not contradict
the disturbance in his reddened eyes. He had
not looked at his caller since her arrival, and he did not
now. Stranger still, he had not spoken to her. A few
gestures and she was in the parlour, seated; the door was
closed and they were alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Vanton,&#8221; began Mermaid. She paused an
instant, then went on: &#8220;I am grown up and it is time
that you told me my story.&#8221;</p>

<p>She saw the hands of the mariner, clasped behind him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
as he paced away from her, tighten. She knew she must
say more to make him address her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain King&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she began.</p>

<p>The heavy tread was cut short. He was standing in
front of her. He was speaking in a throaty voice as if
his words had to carry against the force of a powerful
gale to reach her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak that man&#8217;s name,&#8221; he was saying.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must tell me my story,&#8221; Mermaid repeated.</p>

<p>He stood there irresolutely, an abject figure of shame,
a sea captain unready with an instant decision, an order,
a command, a shouted epithet. He hesitated; and
when he would have put his helm hard over it was too
late.</p>

<p>&#8220;My aunt and I are going to San Francisco,&#8221; the girl
was saying. &#8220;In San Francisco they will remember
Captain King.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now his hands twisted and shook, and again he
turned toward her. He muttered: &#8220;I will tell you all
that matters.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he could not begin. He cleared his throat and
shook his head. His red and tormented eyes looked
her way. She found herself looking directly into them&mdash;and
then away. She could not read all they held;
and she knew she did not want to.</p>

<p>&#8220;You find it difficult. Correct me if I go wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>He made a sound that could be taken for assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was in San Francisco as a very small child,&#8221; Mermaid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
began. &#8220;This I know because the ship, from the
wreck of which I was saved, sailed from there. But I
know it quite as much because Guy has told me about
the city and it recalls something to me. For a long time
it recalled nothing distinct&mdash;only a vague sense of the
familiar. I have thought and thought about it, and
some time ago there came to me a definite image of
something in the past. It was the figure of a man, a
sea captain like yourself, coming and going to the house
or wherever it was that I had my home. I don&#8217;t remember
anything about it. I only remember that
there was someone in it&mdash;it must have been my
mother&mdash;who had a childish voice.... And she
was pretty, too, in a girlish way; at least I suppose she
was. I remember no faces; I remember no figures
except the single figure of the seaman who came and
went; I remember only the childish voice and the sense
of prettiness about me. One other thing I do remember
and that was seasons of fright. I think they were
connected with the coming and going of that seaman.
He was, no doubt, the man you have refused to let me
name. Very well; it is unnecessary to name him.
What I want to know is&mdash;did he live with my mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man in front of her had been standing stock
still. Still with his back turned to her he answered,
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was not my father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>&#8220;Who was?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;John Smiley.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl showed no surprise, only relief. She drew
a deep breath, then murmured: &#8220;Thank God for that!&#8221;</p>

<p>From the motionless figure facing away from her
came a question: &#8220;You knew?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was certain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Both my father and I have seen her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since&mdash;since&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since her death.&#8221;</p>

<p>The standing bulk of Captain Vanton quivered. He
reached for the arm of a chair and collapsed in it.
He kept his back to his visitor.</p>

<p>&#8220;She was drowned at sea?&#8221; Mermaid put the
question in a shaky voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye,&#8221; he answered, and the unexpected word had
in it a ring of terror.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mermaid found herself sobbing silently
in a terrible anguish of thankfulness and wonder and
sorrow. The stifled sound of her weeping filled the
room. Captain Vanton made no move but sat with
his head fallen on his breast, the white sidewhiskers
concealing his profile. His breast rose and fell slowly.</p>

<p>The girl got control of herself, and said: &#8220;I have what
I need to know. The rest does not matter, except as it
concerns&mdash;Guy.&#8221; Her voice trembled again and her
eyes filled. &#8220;Your own story&mdash;that&#8217;s your affair.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
But you have no right to ruin his life because of it&mdash;and
that&#8217;s what you are doing!&#8221;</p>

<p>Something of the awful sternness of the patriarch
sounded in his reply: &#8220;I will save him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words stung the girl. In a moment he had
become a silly and tyrannical and destructive old man
with a fixed idea, a delusion&mdash;the worst possible delusion,
a delusion of a duty to be performed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are making of him a hermit, a recluse, a solitary
and distorted young man,&#8221; she said. Her voice was
like the lash of a whip. &#8220;You have poisoned his mind,
and you will permanently poison his peace and happiness.
Everything that would shame him you have
told him; without knowing what it is you have told him,
I have sensed that. And this has been going on for
years. You have forbidden him to associate with other
boys and other young men. The sunlight of companionship
you have shut away from him. Here in this
desolate house, shrouded in these wintry evergreens,
in the dark, in the damp, in the company of a sick
woman and an old man full of years and past evil, you
have kept him and tried to form him. If he is not
wholly misshapen it is through no omission of yours.
It must stop!&#8221;</p>

<p>She was thinking to herself, in her rage, that of all
madnesses a monomania was the most terrible to contend
with. She was in no doubt as to the form of his
malady. He was obsessed by a notion of saving Guy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
from the snare of the world&#8217;s wickedness into which
he himself had fallen, into which he had seen so many
men fall. He had seen the trap spring and close on
himself and others. Not many had ever escaped it;
those who had were mutilated for life. There had been
this mutilation in his own life. He would not trust
the boy to walk warily, he would not trust himself
to teach him to avoid the snare. He would keep him
where he could not walk into it if he had to seal him
in a living tomb to accomplish his purpose.</p>

<p>With many a boy the undertaking would have been
a preposterous impossibility. With a sensitive youth
of a poetic and dreamy temperament, under absolute
control from earliest childhood, the thing was feasible;
more, it was being done. Mermaid recalled with a
sense of pitiful compunction Guy&#8217;s strange eyes with
their wild animal look, the most characteristic thing
about him. But at least then, in his teens, he had held
up his head, and looked about him. Now....
She had passed him on the street twice and he had not
even seen her. She had spoken to him once and he had
hardly been articulate in his reply; had seemed to hate
and distrust her, not as Mermaid, not as a woman, but
as a person of his own kind.</p>

<p>She came back to a consciousness of what Guy&#8217;s
father, after an interval of silence, was saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;... I have told him only the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The truth! You have not told him the truth, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
shown him the truth. What you have told him is
worse than a lie. For a lie is like certain substances
which are poisonous only in large doses. Strychnine,
for example. Tiny quantities, a nerve tonic; larger
quantities, convulsions and death. But a little truth
is a deadly poison, always. And the only antidote is
more truth and more and more! There cannot be too
much of it; but you have never given him anything
but the truth of two or three persons out of the millions
of men and women that dwell on earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose from her chair, picked up the black bag she
had brought with her, walked around deliberately in
front of the seated man and opening it showed him the
contents&mdash;jewels. Roped pearls and lovely sapphires,
Oriental rubies, diamonds, unnamable stones&mdash;all
the blazing wealth of gems that Keturah Hand had
kept stuffed in a pillow for many years and had lost
one summer on the beach.</p>

<p>&#8220;See,&#8221; said Mermaid, quietly. &#8220;Here is a ransom.
Take it. Let Guy go free. Let him live the life of a
man. Let him stumble and sin and suffer, pick himself
up, breathe the fresh air, and feel the warmth of the
sunshine. You, who choose to live here in the darkness,
can be happy in the artificial light of&mdash;these.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man&#8217;s face became red in a ghastly setting of
white whiskers. He struggled to sit up. He put out
one thick hand and clutched a rope of pearls. Then,
with a great effort, he unclenched his hand and drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
it slowly back to his side as if he were dragging a heavy
weight back with it. He managed to articulate one
word:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They were once Keturah Hawkins&#8217;s,&#8221; she told him.
At the name his shoulders twitched. &#8220;They were
coveted by the mate of the <i>China Castle</i>. He insulted
their owner, and for it he was flogged. I do not know
what crimes they may have been responsible for before
they came into John Hawkins&#8217;s hands. But they have
been responsible, since that time, for a flogging, the
wreck of one life, the destruction of one soul, and now
I offer them to you to save a boy&#8217;s happiness. Will
you take them and be satisfied?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They spell ruin,&#8221; he muttered, thickly. He made
no gesture. Mermaid quietly closed the black bag.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since you will not take them as a ransom I will
return them,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and offer another ransom in
their stead.&#8221; Her low utterance was without the note
of determination and equally without assurance of
success.</p>

<p>He heard the door close after her. Then the man
called Captain Vanton did an unpremeditated thing.
He went to a drawer in the desk at the end of the mahogany
and teakwood cabin-parlour, drew out a
bundle of manuscript, wrote carefully a signature upon
it, and the date, then thrust it back. Again he drew out
something, this time a pistol, and shot himself dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The first thing to note about the manuscript left
by the late Captain Buel Vanton, a resident of Blue
Port, Long Island, who inexplicably shot himself dead
after affixing the date, was unquestionably the name,
written at the end of the document a few seconds before
the author took leave of it&mdash;and a good many other
things&mdash;forever. Captain Vanton signed his narrative,
for a narrative it turned out to be upon examination,
with what had, at first, the appearance of a pen name.
It was entirely legible, and read: &#8220;Jacob King.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not a name of any distinction. It suggested absolutely
nothing to the coroner. In fact, it would have
been regarded as a piece of annoying irrelevance on the
part of the late Captain Vanton had not his son, a
young fellow with a hang-dog look, said sullenly that
it was the real name of the writer. The coroner had
been mightily puzzled and not a little suspicious.
Whereupon Guy Vanton had suggested, still more
sullenly, that the manuscript itself might supply an
explanation fuller and more convincing than his own
assertion. The coroner thereupon turned his attention
again to the document before him, and read it&mdash;a serious
occupation that took him as long as an ordinary inquest.
Yet, in a way, the occupation saved trouble if not time,
for after his perusal the coroner decided that it was
&#8220;a plain case of suicide&mdash;man plumb crazy&mdash;must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
been crazy for years&#8221;; and that an inquest was wholly
unnecessary. As the manuscript on which the late
Captain Vanton (or Jacob King) had lavished so much
literary skill (or insane invention) thus became, through
the coroner&#8217;s intervention, an official record, any one
caring to hunt through the dusty and sneeze-provoking
accumulation of papers in the coroner&#8217;s office could
read it in full, from beginning to end, written, as it
had been, at various times and in various places, in
several colours of ink, but always in the same small,
slanting, distinctive hand. So perused, it ran as follows:</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>I, Jacob King, was born in New York City. I ran away
to sea at the age of 14, and at 19 I was a ship&#8217;s officer.</p>

<p>At 19 I was a man, not a young man but a grown man,
and any one who has followed the sea will know what that
means. The sea ripens a man early, ripens him and fixes
his mind for good or for evil, according to his capacity to
understand the life about him. Nowadays on shore I see
young fellows of 19 that are not much better than children,
except that they have stretched enough to wear long trousers.
That is the life of the land, where such a thing as responsibility
seems to be unknown until men have begun to decay.
I was not that way; and if I had had a better mind I might
have made a success of life. I think I would have been successful
ashore, anyway, for I was quick and clever and never
shirked work; but mostly I think so because I was hard and
young and brazen. I knew how to fight and I knew how to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
bluff. Ashore, it would have been enough to know how to
bluff, I should not have had to fight. At sea a man cannot
succeed, permanently, without actual worth and fighting
and winning. On the land, so far as my observation goes,
actual worth is by no means necessary to success. Any
number of things may make a landsman successful; he may
acquire money or fame and his success is measured by what
of these things he has acquired; it is not measured by the
stuff in him, as it is at sea, but by what he gets hold of; and
if he cannot keep hold of it he becomes a failure again, though
he is no worse a man than before. Landsmen do not value
the man but what he has. By that measure I have become,
I suppose, a pretty successful person ashore; I, who was a
disgrace to salt water, can hold up my head here with some
of the best of them. I am not famous, it is true, but I have
a fortune of $200,000 more or less, a pretty considerable
figure in these days.</p>

<p>At 19 I was a ship&#8217;s officer and at 21 I was a first mate.
It was then, on my first passage as chief officer, that the first
of a series of events which I have to relate occurred. The
ship on which I was then was the fast clipper <i>China Castle</i>,
John Hawkins, master, and the passage was from Boston
to Shanghai. Captain Hawkins was a young man in years,
like myself&mdash;about 26, I think. He had sailed the <i>China
Castle</i> between New York and San Francisco at the time of
the California gold rush and was now taking her out on her
first passage to the East. At last she was to be put into the
tea trade, for which she had been built, but from which she
had been taken from her very launching for the immensely
profitable California route. Besides myself and Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Hawkins there was in the cabin Mrs. Hawkins, his young
wife; she is the only other person aft who matters in my story.
She had not been married to Captain Hawkins long, only a
year or so, and this was her first passage with him and a sort
of deferred honeymoon.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hawkins was a beautiful woman, a young woman, of
course. She was, I think, two or three years younger than
her husband and about as much older than I. She was very
pleasant, as agreeable as she was beautiful; and she did not
stand on ceremony as a captain&#8217;s wife is likely to do. I
suppose this was partly because it was her first voyage and
it may have been partly because we were all about the same
age; but it was mainly her own gracious nature. I, for my
part, had not seen or met many women and I had never seen
or met any woman like her. From a boy I had been to sea,
and while I had been on ships where the captains had their
wives along they had never been women of my own age.
They had never been good-looking women, let alone being
half so lovely as Keturah Hawkins, and I had never been aft
as first officer and privileged to associate with them on terms
of something resembling social equality. Of course, social
equality is impossible on board a ship; but in so far as it
could be brought about Mrs. Hawkins brought it about
in the cabin of the <i>China Castle</i>. That and her beauty
turned my head. She used to wear splendid jewels that
her husband had got for her, though they were nothing to
what he procured afterward, I judge, in the Orient. She
had very fine blue eyes, a bright and flashing blue such as
you see in midocean, particularly in the tropics in fine weather,
the blue of deepest water. Her hair was a dark red, in great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
coils as thick as the heaviest rope cable aboard the ship,
and her skin was a white that did not seem to tan or lose its
whiteness from wind or weather, though sometimes a faint
freckle or two would appear upon it. Her grandniece, though
but a young girl, is wonderfully like her in every appearance.
The sight of this girl tears me to pieces. It brings it all back.
It brings back the hour in which I went clean out of my
senses, sitting there alone in the cabin with Keturah
Hawkins. She did not scream or struggle, but in a moment
she ran away and bolted herself in her room. Of
course when the Captain came down from the poop deck,
where his regular pacing had been audible over our heads
all this time, she told him.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know why he didn&#8217;t shoot me dead; well, yes, I
think I do. I think his wife interceded for me and I think
he believed the proper punishment could only be something
everlastingly shameful and as painful as possible. He had
me triced up by the thumbs and flogged in the sight of the
crew. I was flogged till I lost consciousness. It was two
days before I could stand a watch. My only idea then was
to kill him. I told him so, which was an unnecessary thing
to do. He took precautions, however, such as seeing that
I had no weapons, and never giving me an opportunity to
attack him. Mrs. Hawkins kept to her room; I had my work
to do, and that went on as though nothing had happened.
No private affair, no matter how serious, relaxes the discipline
of the sea. When I told Captain Hawkins that I would kill
him some day he only looked at me and said: &#8220;You&#8217;re a good
ship&#8217;s officer but you&#8217;re a disgrace to salt water. If you
want to kill a man, the first man for you to kill is Jacob King.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>I thought he meant suicide&mdash;&#8220;go drown yourself&#8221; as
the contemptuous phrase of the fo&#8217;c&#8217;s&#8217;le puts it. It was years
before I saw what he meant by that &#8220;If you want to kill a
man, the first man for you to kill is Jacob King.&#8221; I know
now just what he was driving at. I have killed Jacob King.
I have killed my man. I won&#8217;t need to kill another.</p>

<p>But that has come a long time after. A long time. Too
long, maybe.</p>

<p>When we reached Shanghai I got my discharge, of course,
and a good discharge it was, for I had done my work well and
Captain Hawkins, as fine a seaman as ever lived, was strictly
just. I stayed ashore awhile and lived an evil life, drinking
and smoking opium and consorting with thieves and ticket-of-leave
men and all the riffraff of an Eastern seaport. All
the while I was haunted by the remembrance of Keturah
Hawkins. Drunk or sober, sane or in opium dreams, I
saw her&mdash;saw her great cables of dark red hair, her white skin,
her dazzling blue eyes, her delightful smile that she had
smiled expressly for the benefit of the young and capable
first mate of her husband&#8217;s fine ship. If I had been able
to do it I would have possessed myself of her even then. I
would have killed her husband, I would have killed every one
aboard the <i>China Castle</i>, to have her. In opium dreams I
did kill them all; I slew all Shanghai and burned the city and
launched as many ships to pursue her as were launched to
bring back Helen from ancient Troy. All dreams, all mad
delusions! I was a fevered, burning, babbling, stupefied
wretch of a sailor with no money in my pockets and nothing
to fall back upon but a splendid ruggedness of body and a
good discharge as first mate.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>The good discharge was sufficient to get me a berth on a
ship sailing for San Francisco. Once at sea again I was all
right except in my mind. That had been all twisted and
distorted by the punishment inflicted upon me by Captain
Hawkins. I couldn&#8217;t get over the disgrace of it; which was
deserved, of course, though I didn&#8217;t think so. I kept thinking
of myself as a man who had been shamed beyond all deserving.
I was convinced that I had merely been too rashly assuming,
and that if I had gone about it differently or had taken more
time, had not acted so impulsively&mdash;&mdash; All this was self-deception,
of course, and it degraded Keturah Hawkins,
in my thoughts, at least. Perhaps I thought that if I could
not lift myself up to her I could pull her down to my level.
What I didn&#8217;t see was that a good woman&mdash;or a good man
either, likely&mdash;cannot be lowered by whatever baseness
any one may choose to think or say. The only person that
is lowered is the thinker or the sayer. You&#8217;ll find this and
a whole lot more coiled away in that poem of Emerson&#8217;s
about Brahma: &#8220;I am the thinker and the thought,&#8221; or
something like that, it runs. I don&#8217;t know whether a man
makes the thought that passes through his mind, but I do
know that the thought makes the man. At least, it made
me. I was still Jacob King, but I wasn&#8217;t the same Jacob
King. Something in me had been poisoned. The slow
poisoning of&mdash;&mdash;? The swiftest poison is not the most sure.</p>

<p>I was very bad, I mean mentally, when I got to San Francisco,
and the life I led there did not mend me. Gradually
as I kept seeing the image of Keturah Hawkins in all states
of sleep and waking, at all hours and under the influence of
all sorts of drugs and in the midst of all kinds of surroundings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the image itself faded; or changed and coarsened. I did
not notice that the dazzling blue, as of sunshine trying vainly
to shaft through unfathomable depths, had disappeared
from her eyes, but soon I could no longer see those heavy
cables of dark red hair, made up of so many twisted strands,
nor the wonderful milky whiteness of the skin. The features
became indistinct, and soon I saw clearly nothing but the
magnificent jewels she had worn&mdash;the ropes of pearls that
took lustre from her skin; the emeralds that shone in green
drops in the rich, dark, smouldering red of her hair; the
sapphires that seemed to condense and make permanent the
more brilliant blue of her eyes. About these gems that she
had worn there was the glitter, the undying glitter of hard
stones. All that was lovely, all that was spiritual, all that
was human in the vision of her perished; and still the splendour
of those jewels remained. I used to see her as an imperceptible
outline&mdash;no face, no rounded arm, no wealth of
hair, just an imagined outline with here and there certain
gorgeous jewels in an ornamental and decorative arrangement&mdash;fastened
on the air. At such times I went clean
crazy, but I could do nothing. I was getting too besotted
to straighten up for any length of time. And there wasn&#8217;t
any cure. How could there be? I couldn&#8217;t cure myself.
I was being poisoned by the irremediable past. How abolish
the past? It&#8217;s all very well to talk about living a thing down,
but the only thing that can be lived down is the thing that
wasn&#8217;t entirely so. My past was.</p>

<p>It was in San Francisco that I got acquainted with a man
named Hosea Hand and came into a strange relationship
with his brother, one Richard Hand. Hosea Hand was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
sailor, one of the crew of the ship on which I had come from
Shanghai. He was younger than I, and after we got to
San Francisco and the ship&#8217;s discipline relaxed I saw a good
deal of him, first and last. One day in a lonely mood he
told me his story. His brother had cheated him out of an
inheritance, or so he figured, and he had run away to sea,
like myself, as a boy. Two things about the story struck
me: his brother, if what he said was true, might pay money
to have him stay away from home&mdash;not that Hosea Hand had
any thought of returning home but I could represent him
as being bent on doing so, and myself as able to keep him
away, for a price; the other thing&mdash;and this impressed and
excited me much the more strongly&mdash;was that the Hand
farm was on Long Island not far from the little town of Blue
Port where Keturah Hawkins had her home. I turned
the whole thing over in my mind during the sodden days and
nights of a week. I do not believe that in the condition
I was in all that time I was capable of reaching a bold decision&mdash;not
even boldly evil. At last I wrote to Richard
Hand. I told him that I, a stranger to him, not only knew
his brother&#8217;s whereabouts but knew his story; and I had found
Hosea Hand resolved to return home and settle accounts.
I could keep the boy away, but must have something for
doing it. It would be a sensible thing for him to do business
with me. I wanted money, and I wanted information.
His reply and its enclosure would be evidence of good faith.</p>

<p>He replied; and it was plain that he was frightened.
Hosea Hand was no longer in San Francisco, having shipped
on a vessel for New York. Richard Hand did not send much
money, but any sum looked large to me at the moment. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
spent the money in one night, and began to consider how
I could get more, or how I should proceed next, having in
mind the fact that the young brother had expressed an intention
of going home. If he did so, I knew he would not bother
Richard Hand further than to tell him to his face that he was
a cheat and might go to the devil as fast as he liked. Then
I should be unable to get more money. I wrote to Richard
Hand&mdash;the letter would reach him before his brother appeared&mdash;asking
about Captain Hawkins. Where was he, where
was his wife, what were their means, what connections had
they? Richard Hand sent back a pretty full account of the
Hawkinses. Both were at sea at the time. There was
property. They had no child as yet. Mrs. Hawkins had
an older sister, married, with two children, a boy and a
girl. Their name was Smiley and the girl was named after
Mrs. Hawkins. In the event of the Hawkinses remaining
childless, these two would most likely inherit their property.
All this did not interest me much and I wrote no more to
Richard Hand at that time. Of a sudden the passion for
that woman of the dark red hair and milky skin reawakened
in me. I was young; I shook off my dissipation, and set out
to find her.</p>

<p>In all sorts of ships and in any sort of berth I went about
the world, from seaport to seaport; and as I was a good ship&#8217;s
officer I had no trouble to get about. I sailed from San
Francisco to New York, and there I heard that Captain
Hawkins had left the <i>China Castle</i> and was somewhere on
the Western Ocean, as seamen term the North Atlantic,
with cotton for Liverpool. I followed, as nearly as possible,
but got to Liverpool after he had sailed on his return trip.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
A long chase followed. There is no point in setting it down
here. It lasted for years. We three ranged from Singapore
to Boston and from Rotterdam to the Cape Settlement.
Twice in that time I caught glimpses of Keturah Hawkins.
Once I saw her standing on the afterdeck of her husband&#8217;s
ship, clearing from Havre as we entered the harbour; again
I saw her driven past, on a boulevard in Rio de Janeiro.
The third time I did not have merely a glimpse of her but
met her face to face.</p>

<p>It was totally unexpected. I did not even know that the
other vessel in the harbour of Almeria was her husband&#8217;s.
Almeria is a Spanish town with nothing to recommend it to
any one except the trader. I was in ballast and called on the
chance of a cargo&mdash;grapes or anything. Above the town,
on the bare brown hills, lies the ruin of the Moorish fort,
just a long enclosure, a masonry wall about shoulder high,
with embrasures. It is the only thing to see. She had come
ashore to see it, leaving her husband supervising the work
of loading cargo, a job he never left entirely to his mate. I
was wandering around with a young Spaniard; not that either
of us could understand the other very well but some kind
of company seemed essential. We came upon her, all alone,
a foolhardy thing, but she had superb self-confidence. She
lifted her eyes, saw me, half turned and started away, walking
steadily but with no appearance of flight. I overtook
her. I don&#8217;t know, as I live, what I said, but whatever it
was she never answered, nor did she look at me. As we
passed through the gateway out of the fort she paused for
an instant and gave a beggar a small coin. At that moment
I saw Captain Hawkins approaching.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>He looked straight at me, never moving a muscle of his
face, approached her, and said something in an undertone,
a request to wait, I imagine. Then he came toward me and
I turned and led the way into the fort, within those shell-like
walls four centuries old. Inside I faced him. It was easy
to see what was coming.</p>

<p>I was beaten, badly beaten. His fists, hard as iron belaying
pins, broke down my defence and hammered blows upon
my head, my shoulders, my body. I was soon winded and
down, and still he did not leave off beating me. He kicked
me about as I grovelled there in the fine dust of that Moorish
citadel, the outpost of Granada. I was a dog and he used
me like a dog. When I was senseless he left. How I got out
of it I don&#8217;t know; I think the young Spaniard got others to
help him and put me on board my vessel. When I recovered
the next day the other ship had gone.</p>

<p>All the evil in me was loosed by this adventure. I swore
to myself that I would be revenged upon those people and any
and all of their people, and that I would live if only to accomplish
that. But eighteen months in which I lost all track
of the Hawkinses cooled that purpose. I married, and
Keturah Hawkins was half forgotten. Of my marriage it
is not necessary to say anything. It took place in San
Francisco and was forced upon me at the point of a pistol.
My wife died within a year. I left the sea and became a
prospector when I was not an idler. I was nearly 50 when
a child was born. This is the boy known as Guy Vanton.
After his mother&#8217;s death, very shortly after, I struck it rich.
Concerning my money and the source of it I have nothing to
say; concerning the boy&#8217;s mother nothing except that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
were not married. I may not be his father, but I am the
only father he has known. All these things I have told him.
I would save him, if possible, from what has befallen me.
You will see what that is shortly.</p>

<p>After I became rich&mdash;so rich that I could not waste my
substance in a night, or a week, or a year; so old that caution
was the stronger impulse always and made me hoard
what I had&mdash;after the death of Guy Vanton&#8217;s mother I
lived just outside San Francisco with the boy and the memories
of a vicious life. There is nothing like old age to intensify
the good or evil in a man. Here was I with my
memories, which all at once, in my loneliness, became vivid,
alive, crawling. I thought of Keturah Hawkins and writhed.
I thought of her jewels and a terrible greed filled me. I
thought of that flogging on the <i>China Castle</i> and my shoulders
twitched; of the impact of Captain Hawkins&#8217;s fists and quivered,
half raising a protective arm. I wrote again to Richard
Hand and learned that these two people were dead; that
their nephew had married and displeased Keturah Hawkins;
that her fortune had gone to her niece. From Richard Hand
I was able to learn something about these persons and to
figure out a way I might strike at them and hurt or crush
them. How was I able to get this out of him? Partly by
threats to show him up as compounding with me to keep his
brother out of a lawful inheritance; partly with money. I
have no time for details and there are things that are better
to go forever unrecorded.</p>

<p>It was I, Jacob King, who hired a man to make love to and
fascinate John Smiley&#8217;s wife. It was an easy thing to do,
with her husband mostly absent on the beach. To avoid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the townspeople&#8217;s eyes was more difficult, but it was managed
with secret meetings of one sort or another. She was led
to leave him, taking her baby girl with her; eventually she
was led to me. How much of this Richard Hand surmised
I don&#8217;t know or care. But he had no part in it beyond giving
me facts about the Smileys to go upon.</p>

<p>I subjected Mary Smiley to all the tortures I could devise.
She lived with me though she was John Smiley&#8217;s wife. She
was a silly, childish creature and she was absolutely at my
mercy. I made her life a hell for several years. In the meantime,
her little girl was growing&mdash;into a tiny image of Keturah
Hawkins. It was that which conquered me, or the settled
wickedness within me. I, who had set out to wreak remotely
my revenge on Keturah Hawkins, was myself becoming
the victim of a living punishment. For here was
Keturah Hawkins in the house with me. Every physical
characteristic was there in the child later known as Mermaid
Smiley, the daughter of John Smiley and Mary Rogers
Smiley, the grandniece of the woman I remembered. The
child had Keturah Hawkins&#8217;s hair, eyes, skin, and features;
even, in embryo, her manner. I could torture her silly and
pitiable mother and the child would enter the room, a living
taunt to me. Here she was, and she would outlive me; she
would be flesh and blood, wonderful glinting hair, flashing
blue eyes, matchless white skin, unconquerably alive and
superb, unconquerably young and gay when I was not merely
a cruel and old and despicable man, but dust. She would
dance on my grave.</p>

<p>I stood it as long as I could and then something happened
within me, a mental overthrow comparable to the physical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
defeats I had suffered because of Keturah Hawkins. Something
in the continual presence of that child rained blows
upon me until I was numb in my mind, until I couldn&#8217;t think
or plan at all, until the torture I could inflict on her mother
was a meaningless thing; and there had always been a terrible
futility about it for the reason that I could not make my
revenge anywhere near complete and satisfactory. I could
not, for instance, communicate to John and Keturah Smiley
the triumph of vengeance that was mine. John Hawkins
was not alive to witness it; Keturah Hawkins&mdash;&mdash; Was she
alive, in the person of that child, to see it? Perhaps, and
perhaps she was alive in the person of that child to thwart
it. She would beat me down; dead or living she would best
me. A superstitious, or perhaps a holy, terror laid hold of
me so that I dared not lay hands on the little girl, or even say
to her things that might bring tears to childish eyes. I
dared not, I tell you! And besides, it would be laying hands
on Keturah herself.</p>

<p>You see the situation? Do you see how the poison of
evil had worked in me all these years, how it had dominated
me for a time, how it had lain dormant, how it had cropped
out hideously like some unspeakable and inexterminable
disease? Silently through the years it had corrupted me,
corrupting my mind even more than my body, more insidiously
and more surely, and with more deadly a result. And
at last from a small boat on San Francisco Bay&mdash;we had gone
into the city to live&mdash;John Smiley&#8217;s wife was drowned. I
was left with the child on my hands and with no embodiment
for my fancied vengeance. I think I went nearly insane
then, if I was not insane already.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>I determined to make what atonement I could. I took
certain cowardly precautions and prepared to send the child
back to her father. There is something supernatural in the
manner in which that return was accomplished. I did not
learn of it for some years. I took the boy, Guy, and went to
Paris, taking a servant with me in the semblance of my wife
and his mother. She became an invalid abroad, but I have
not cast her off.</p>

<p>In Paris I came to see that my atonement must be as
complete as I could make it. So I came back to New York
and made inquiries through Richard Hand. I was then
&#8220;Captain Vanton,&#8221; or &#8220;Buel Vanton&#8221; but I wrote him as
Jacob King. He replied; from what he told me&mdash;and I
paid him, of course&mdash;I was able to piece together the truth
that was hidden from him and from others. The next step
was the appearance of Captain Vanton in Blue Port.</p>

<p>The rest, externally, is known; what can never be known
is the suffering I have endured. It is all deserved and much
more, no doubt, but endurance is nearing an end. I am
probably insane in some peculiar fashion. I see nothing
but jewels; jewels arranged as if in the hair and on the bosom
of an invisible woman. Then I see Keturah Hawkins, a
very young Keturah Hawkins, but Keturah Hawkins beyond
question, pass along the street&mdash;and she wears no jewels.
I think her aunt has them, and some day in my madness I
shall break in and steal them, just to handle them, these
stones that touched her white skin and were nested in that
wine-dark hair. Pray God, I may never lay hold of them or
I shall go raving mad! The girl, this reincarnation of the
woman I once held in my arms, I have no further concern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
with. If ever she comes to me to know her story I shall tell
her. But she is Keturah. She knows.</p>

<p>The boy, young Guy, I have kept close by me, and I have
told him some of this shameful story in order that, if he
does indeed have any of my blood in his veins, he may have,
in knowledge of the truth, some antidote to its poison. The
girl will have money, and I will provide for the boy.</p>

<p>The girl and boy are friends; something else may ripen of
their friendship. If he is my son and if, as may be, she loves
him, or comes to love him, will that be a final triumphant
twist in my favour against Keturah? Will that be the last
word&mdash;my word&mdash;in this problem of revenge? You see,
you see how deeply it has poisoned me. Perhaps I will
anticipate the end.</p></blockquote>

<p>The signature of &#8220;Jacob King&#8221; completed this narrative,
obviously too incredible in its statements and
too monomaniacal in its tone to have any bearing on
the death of Captain Buel Vanton from a pistol wound,
self-inflicted.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; said the smooth-shaven young man&mdash;young
but evidently not so very young, either. His
pale face had dark circles under the strange-lighted
eyes. His black, straight hair was not brushed. The
wind which ruffled it brought no colour to his cheeks.
His nostrils&mdash;he had rather a snub nose&mdash;twitched.
At his sides his hands kept closing and unclosing, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
he stood stiffly, like a scarecrow absurdly taken from a
field and firmly rooted in this spot on the sand of the
Great South Beach.</p>

<p>The young woman who faced him, with her glowing
hair and her eyes and skin which seemed to reflect
every atom of the downpouring sunlight, made no
gesture, but met his denial with an affirmation. Two
words pronounced in a low, vibrating voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;You can.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were ordinary young people of the twentieth
century in appearance, the one perhaps more striking
in beauty, the other certainly more distraught, than the
average of their ages. But, except for the absence of
any archaism from their speech, they might have been
speakers in a drama as dark as &#8220;Hamlet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are thirty,&#8221; began the girl; &#8220;I am twenty-four.
You have a fortune&mdash;well, $200,000 anyway. Enough
for our needs. You have another inheritance, and I
do not mean a blood inheritance. You are not likely
to be the son of Jacob King.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the son of Jacob King&#8217;s&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say it,&#8221; she interrupted, quietly. &#8220;She has
not mattered these thirty years, why should she now?
No, the inheritance I mean is not of blood, but of dread,
shame, and repulsion. Isn&#8217;t it enough, Guy, that in
his crazed lifetime he did everything that a man could
do to make you as bad as himself? Are you going to
let him rule you now that he is dead? Are you going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
to accept that inheritance? For you need not. While
he lived he dominated your life, he made you share his
thoughts, he made you an innocent accomplice in evil;
you were an accessory after the fact of his wrong-doing.
But now he has liberated you. When he shot himself
dead it was an act of emancipation. He struck the
shackles from you and set you free at the same instant
that he went forward to meet his sentence and punishment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; repeated the man, hopelessly. &#8220;You
forget the living tie, the woman there in the house, the
one who is known as Mrs. Vanton.&#8221; The words seemed
to hurt his throat.</p>

<p>The woman&#8217;s breast rose and fell, but there was
tremendous control in her over herself, and she exerted
some of it in her answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is only one thing to do,&#8221; she assured him.
&#8220;It is to sever everything that joins you with him,
dead or alive. Do this: put the inheritance money
in a trust. The income will care for&mdash;for Mrs.
Vanton, completely: medical attendance, nursing,
everything. Give her the house, give her every dollar,
but leave! You can take every precaution to see
that she is properly cared for but you must get away.
You must have a physical and a mental escape. You
have got to renounce the past and everything in the
present that threads you to the past. You have got
to get out into a sunlit world, a world of normal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
men and women, of fighting and playing and loving,
of shops and homes, of marriage and children, of discomforts
and hardships, adventures and trifling worries
and happiness. At thirty you must act, you who have
been passive and acted upon. You have a life to live.
Live it. Oh, Guy, live your own life!&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned away from him. Something in her voice
galvanized him, communicated an electric thrill along
the dead circuit of his nerves, startled him, shocked
him from his inertia. He looked up quickly, took
a step or two, and saw that she was crying. As if it
were a reflex action he took two steps more and stood
beside her, then put his arm timidly about her. For
one instant she relaxed slightly, so that her weight fell
upon the arm, then she was alive again and turned to
him a smiling face with cheeks still wet.</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter what you do,&#8221; she assured him.
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you do this? You aren&#8217;t in trim, physically;
that&#8217;s plain. You&#8217;re in need of conditioning,
some sort of outdoor life, something that will harden
you. And you need company, companionship. Why
not stay here on the beach this summer and then
through next winter with my father at the Coast Guard
station? He can&#8217;t take you on as a surfman, of course,
for you&#8217;d have to pass an examination. Though you
might do that, a surfman has to have had several years
experience as a bayman, too. But you could be a sort
of volunteer member of the crew. You wouldn&#8217;t make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
any money but you won&#8217;t need any money. You&#8217;ll
have bad hours, but fewer than you suppose. You
won&#8217;t even have the ordinary loneliness, for you can&#8217;t
take a beach patrol and you&#8217;ll always be out with one
of the other men. And there&#8217;s Tommy Lupton&mdash;he&#8217;s
here. You and he can travel together; you&#8217;re good
friends. And Uncle Ho. Aunt Keturah can&#8217;t persuade
him to leave the beach permanently. She says,&#8221; Mermaid
smiled at the recollection, &#8220;she says that marriage
with him has made no difference, that she sees him as
often as ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t to look a long way ahead,&#8221; she continued.
&#8220;You oughtn&#8217;t to. Those who look too far
ahead see the reflection of the past. You must live,
as nearly as possible, from day to day. Plan for a
year and plan, in the circumstances, no farther. Keep
to the beach. Keep to the men, especially Uncle Ho
and Tommy. They have something they can share
with you, something you need above everything else
just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>So it was decided and so arranged. Mermaid, who
was concerned over her aunt&#8217;s health, felt that to go
to California might do Keturah Hand a world of good.
It could be tried, anyway. She came over to the beach
one morning to say good-bye to her father, to Hosea
Hand, to the men generally, one or two of whom, particularly
Joe Sayre, remembered her from her childhood
among them. And to say good-bye to Guy Vanton.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>He already looked better physically, she thought,
noting the trace of colour in his face and the absence
of the dark rings from under his eyes. Their gaze met
as they said good-bye. His curious, fawn-like glance
was fixed on the shining blue surfaces that hid such
great deeps within her eyes, a wild creature of the shore
looking with wonder on the unfathomable sea. He said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye. I shall see you every time the sun shines
on the ocean. You&mdash;you must come back. Please
do write to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be back,&#8221; she answered, with calm warmth.
Only the blue opacity of her eyes concealed the great
tides moving within her. &#8220;I shall write. Work hard.
Sand and sea and sun are great chemicals to act upon
the mind. The beach here is so like a desert island.
You must think of yourself as on a desert island, cut
off by the sea of present living from the lands of past
remembrance. And eventually, like Atlantis, those
lands will sink beneath the sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a firm handclasp they parted.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>On the train travelling westward Mermaid and her
aunt had some talk of events, recent and not so recent.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why did you take my jewels?&#8221; demanded
Keturah.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because they worried you. They were like a piece
of bone, a tiny fragment pressing on the brain,&#8221; responded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
the young woman. &#8220;I knew that if they disappeared
in such a way as to make it seem that they
had been stolen&mdash;and I suppose, strictly, they were
stolen&mdash;the worrying would cease. What made you
think of Captain Vanton as the thief?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because it was impossible to think of any one else,
I suppose,&#8221; said Mrs. Hand. &#8220;And while I never
guessed that he was the man King, still he evidently
knew more about King than any of us did; and King
had known or seen Keturah Hawkins and knew of or
had seen the stones. Any one might want to steal
them who knew about them. And he did.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mermaid had a question in turn:</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have thought Uncle Ho would have recognized
Captain Vanton as the Jacob King he had
known in San Francisco.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Child, half a century had elapsed between his acquaintance
with Jacob King and the appearance of
Captain Vanton in Blue Port. Then, those sidewhiskers....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dickie will come out next week,&#8221; Mermaid said,
absently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to marry young Dick Hand?&#8221;
Keturah inquired, with her natural abruptness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt, you wouldn&#8217;t have me marry a man just because
he asks me, would you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hope you wouldn&#8217;t marry him without his
asking you to.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>&#8220;I might ask him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dickie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no&mdash;that is&mdash;I mean&mdash;Dickie has asked me,
but I mean I might&mdash;sometime&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Mermaid seemed
unnecessarily embarrassed. Her aunt looked at her
intently; then, as if she thought it better to swerve
the conversation slightly, remarked abruptly: &#8220;Well,
old Richard Hand died a natural death at the end of
his unnatural life, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you can call death from fear a natural
death,&#8221; objected the younger woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fear! What was he afraid of?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was partly senile, of course, but he could not
be convinced that Captain Vanton was really dead.
He heard more or less of Captain Vanton&#8217;s story.
The coroner didn&#8217;t give it out, but things like that always
get around, or some of them. When they told
him that Captain Vanton was Jacob King, he had a
stroke. Paralysis. After that he kept looking about
him and saying: &#8216;The King is dead! Long live the
King!&#8217; And when they told him that Captain Vanton
had been buried he cried out: &#8216;Nothing is ever buried.
He&#8217;ll come to life again.&#8217; Later he had delusions
that he saw King or Vanton. Do you remember when
Dad went to see him? He caught sight of Dad and
shrieked: &#8216;Don&#8217;t kill me, John Smiley! I didn&#8217;t steal
your daughter! Kill King! Only you can&#8217;t kill him!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mermaid finished with a shudder.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>Mrs. Hand asked: &#8220;How much of the whole story
does young Dick know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His father&#8217;s part in it pretty fully. The rest&mdash;about
Guy and Mrs. Vanton and all&mdash;no more than
the other Blue Port people. About all they know is
that Mrs. Vanton wasn&#8217;t the Captain&#8217;s wife and that
the Captain was a mad old man who made his boy&#8217;s
life miserable and who had had something underhanded
to do with Richard Hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always wondered what you told that man to
make him tell you that you were John Smiley&#8217;s daughter,&#8221;
Mrs. Hand remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only what I guessed. He was ready to tell me,&#8221;
said Mermaid. &#8220;I was really fighting for Guy. I
offered your jewels to him as a ransom for Guy. It
sounds ridiculous, but since I knew you thought he
had taken them I knew you must think he coveted
them, had some craving that they might satisfy. I
was more or less in the dark; I went ahead by instinct.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wonder, since he shot himself right after you
left the house, that you were not accused of murder,&#8221;
said Keturah, grimly. &#8220;You might have shot him dead
and walked away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget Mrs. Vanton,&#8221; Mermaid reminded her.
&#8220;She had come to the head of the stairs. She saw
the door close after me. It was two or three minutes
later before she heard the pistol shot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s honest, it seems.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, poor creature.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mary,&#8221; asked Keturah Hand as she leaned forward
while her niece adjusted the pillows behind her in the
big Pullman chair, &#8220;when that man refused the jewels
you told him that you would offer another ransom for
Guy Vanton. What had you in mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>The younger woman was behind her aunt. Mrs.
Hand twisted about suddenly to see her face. It was
flushed, but Mermaid&#8217;s deep and brilliant eyes met
her aunt&#8217;s unflinchingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would have married Guy,&#8221; she said, her voice
vibrating slightly. &#8220;His father&mdash;that is, that man&mdash;talked
about saving him. I would have matched my
salvation of him against his&mdash;father&#8217;s. I would have
fought for him against all the past evil that was dragging
him down. Now his father is dead. He can&mdash;possibly&mdash;pull
himself out alone, unaided. If not, I
am &#8216;standing by.&#8217; Oh, yes&mdash;I love him,&#8221; she finished,
answering the interrogation that leaped from Keturah
Hand&#8217;s eyes.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>In the sunshine of California, in the cheerfulness of
life in San Francisco, Keturah grew steadily better.
Dick Hand executed a variety of projects, and only
Mermaid remained unstirred and uninfluenced by her
surroundings, by the change of air and scene. It is
perhaps wrong to speak of her as &#8220;unstirred.&#8221; She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
was stirred and very deeply, but by no trifle of environment
or of company. Down in her the great tides
were swinging, moving resistlessly and in vast volume,
imperceptible in their drift and direction on the surface.
As was inevitable, Dick Hand again asked her to marry
him and this time she gave him a final refusal. She did
not put him off. She knew it would be useless. The
current had set and was sweeping on through her.
She could chart it, and she knew it would not shift.
Something tremendous, something massive in her life
would be required to deflect it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; she asked herself, &#8220;should I pretend to myself
any longer? I love Guy Vanton. I think I have
always loved him. He is in peril and he needs my help.
When he was caught in the surf did I wait to see if
he could save himself? Not one instant! Why do I
wait now? Why do I risk losing him, by letting him
drown, forever? It isn&#8217;t right.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did up her hair in great coils, like thick cables
of ship&#8217;s rope, and it seemed to her that each separate
strand, so slender, so easily snapped, redoubled in its
tensile power as it was gathered with the hundreds of
others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Life,&#8221; she thought to herself, &#8220;is like that. We
are tied to the past by a thousand filaments, every one
of them slight, fragile, easily snapped, quickly broken.
But they are all twisted together. They are like this
coil of hair. They are like a thousand threads spun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
together, not to be snapped, not to be broken. A
thousand things join Guy to the past. Some of the
threads join the two of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>A fresh thought struck her.</p>

<p>&#8220;He can never escape wholly from his past. And I
am almost the only thing or person in it that is pleasant
or even halfway wholesome for him to remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>She recalled what she had told him, that he must
no longer be passive but must act. Did not this counsel
apply to herself? She knew she wanted him. She
knew he wanted her. But however great his want of
her he could not and would not call upon her to make
what might be the sacrifice of a life&mdash;her life&mdash;to save
his own. How could he, a man nearing middle age,
really nameless, a child of disgrace and the son and heir
of evil, lonely, sensitive, not unliked, but virtually
friendless&mdash;how could he ask her to become his wife?
He could ask of her nothing that she did not freely
and of her own impulse offer and give him&mdash;friendship,
sympathy, help, advice. The last item had an ironical
ring in Mermaid&#8217;s consciousness. Advice to the drowning!</p>

<p>If he had the strength to save himself he had that
strength, and that was all there was to it. For what
was she waiting? To see him exercise it? But she
loved him. It was not proof of his strength she required.
What he had, what he lacked, was nothing&mdash;simply
nothing. If he hadn&#8217;t it, she had strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
enough for two. Suppose she failed? Suppose she
knew she would fail? The old image persisted before
her. If he were drowning and she knew that her effort
to save him would not succeed, would she abandon
him, just stand there watching, or await what would
happen with averted eyes? Of course not. You had
to make the effort no matter if it was absolutely foredoomed
to failure. And this effort which confronted
her was not necessarily foredoomed at all; at least, so
far as she or any one else could see. They might shake
their heads but they could not tell.</p>

<p>In her way, the best way she could manage, she put
this to her aunt, who listened almost silently until the
end and then said, suddenly and abruptly: &#8220;Of
course, Mary, if you love him&mdash;why, that settles everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mermaid felt bound to insist on the logic leading
to this conclusion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Hand, irritably. &#8220;You
can&#8217;t reason about such a thing. When two persons
love each other it settles everything&mdash;and unsettles
everything, too,&#8221; she added. &#8220;There&#8217;s only one thing
to do, and there&#8217;s only one person to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s really no reason why a woman shouldn&#8217;t
propose to a man,&#8221; continued Keturah. &#8220;I&#8217;m no
great respecter of conventions. You may remember
the time when I used to wear a man&#8217;s old coat. Conventions
were made for the man and not man for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
conventions, except political conventions.&#8221; She was
resorting, as was not unusual with her, to flippancy to
cover emotion. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know but that I may be said
to have proposed to your Uncle Hosea, when I got
money that was rightfully his from his brother and put
it in his hands, indirectly, as a lover sends a box of
flowers to his sweetheart. Only I couldn&#8217;t have the
florist, Lawyer Brown, put my card in the box,&#8221; she
noted. &#8220;However, it wasn&#8217;t necessary; it seldom is.
You always know who sent the flowers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe, though I don&#8217;t know, that Keturah
Hawkins proposed to John Hawkins,&#8221; she went on.
&#8220;John was a speechless sort of man all his life. I&#8217;m
sure he never brought himself to utter any such words
as: &#8216;Will you marry me?&#8217; They would have choked
him. I suspect that at the proper time Keturah began
calmly to talk about plans for the house I live in, progressing
by easy stages to such matters as the date of
the wedding and the clothes he would need, down to his
underwear, winter weight.</p>

<p>&#8220;They say the way to resume is to resume, but often
the way to begin is to resume, too. Each night that
John called, Keturah resumed the subject she had not
discussed the night before; and so they were married
and lived happily ever after.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mermaid, reduced to laughter by this narration,
said: &#8220;Well, to resume what we were not talking about
just now, I shall go East day after to-morrow if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
are willing. I will bring Guy out here and then I can
see you home. You ought not to travel alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think you are going away and leave me in
this place 3,000 miles from Blue Port, missy!&#8221; exclaimed
her aunt. &#8220;I won&#8217;t stay here. Besides, Dick Hand
is cross as a catamount since you told him for the last
time that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Hand broke off the sentence as she might have
bitten off a thread of unnecessary length. She looked
at her niece and sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a fine woman, my dear,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Come
here and kiss me. You don&#8217;t have to put your mind
on it. Just a dutiful kiss will do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mermaid kissed her with undutiful violence.</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>They met, the two, on the beach, on a long sweep of
the ocean shore where snipe were running at the edge
of the lacy waves but where there was no other human
being within sight or sound of them. They had met,
you may say, before&mdash;at the Lone Cove Coast Guard
Station, for instance, where Mermaid had kissed her
father and shaken hands with everybody, including the
one or two surviving honorary uncles of her childhood.
They had sat them down at the long table over which
Cap&#8217;n Smiley still presided, encouraging the art of
conversation as one of those social amenities that
marked the civilized man. They had eaten heartily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
of simple and appetizing fare, had joked, laughed,
told stories. Mermaid had been delighted at the physical
transformation in Guy. He was broader shouldered,
or certainly seemed so, and was obviously heavier,
&#8220;filled out,&#8221; as her father put it. The colour in his
cheeks was a thing to wonder at; so was the calm of his
eyes. They were still those wild-animal eyes, but the
look in them was that of a creature at peace with the
world and, for the rest, unafraid. He was, except
for the fact of a somewhat wider education, one of
them.</p>

<p>But that had not been a meeting. This was their
meeting, here on the smooth and endless stretch of hard-packed
sand at the ocean&#8217;s edge.</p>

<p>They stood side by side, not looking at each other
but at the ocean, at the curling, magnificent breakers
which the southeast wind was driving in. The sun
shone, the air was magic. Bird cries reached them,
a tiny treble to the bass of the water&#8217;s roar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Out of the ocean you came,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Will you
slip away and return into it again some day, I wonder?
Mermaid! The name is poetry and the story is romance.
When you go back, you must look for me.
I shall be a wreathed Triton, blowing upon a conch
shell. I shall be among those who pull the sea god&#8217;s
chariot while you will be among those who swim in his
escort. And we shall be much together. Always.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have done it!&#8221; she said, exultingly. &#8220;You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
have become a man, and yet you have not lost the child
and the poet in you. You are really the Guy Vanton
I first knew, only grown, matured, with the world before
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have it all yet to conquer,&#8221; he told her, half
laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your greatest conquest has been made.&#8221;</p>

<p>He reached for her hand, pressed it, and held it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guy,&#8221; she said, suddenly, &#8220;will you marry me?&#8221;</p>

<p>She felt his hand tremble. The tremendous tide
within her swept on, and in her ears there was a noise
like singing. She felt his arm about her, and it was
needed. She made out his voice, saying: &#8220;Mermaid,
will you have me? Will you&mdash;have&mdash;me? Oh, if you
will!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a cry of entreaty, a prayer, a thanksgiving.</p>

<p>She suddenly slipped down onto the sand and quite
ridiculously collapsed in a heap. And he was on the
sand beside her, folding her to him, murmuring little
words that were inaudible and precious. She felt
his hair against her cheek and for an instant their
strange eyes confronted each other. In his were brown
and golden lights; hers were less brilliantly blue, as
if the surface reflection were gone, and looking into them
it would be possible, almost for the first time, to guess
at the depths concealed by their mirror-like quality.</p>

<p>They sat there for a long time while the sun declined
slowly through the heavens, a futile effort of the wheeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
universe to measure by cycles and hours a moment
of eternity.</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>The death of &#8220;Mrs. Vanton&#8221;&mdash;no one ever was heartless
enough to call her anything else&mdash;left entirely to
Guy the moderate fortune which had been Captain
Vanton&#8217;s. And now he had a use for it.</p>

<p>Mermaid and her husband travelled about, crossing
the Atlantic and visiting Paris, where Guy showed
his wife some scenes of his boyhood. They rambled
through little towns. And in these the streets seemed
always to be crowded with youngsters at play.</p>

<p>Mermaid had hold of Guy&#8217;s arm. He felt her red-gold
hair brush his cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;Children!&#8221; he said, and fell silent. &#8220;We, too, were
children once. I think we will always remain children,
you and I. The spirit does not die, but the body must
be renewed. It is ours to renew it.&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked on together, and everywhere the children
looked up from the excitement and laughter of their
games to glance at them interestedly or disinterestedly,
curiously or with indifference, and here and there they
caught a smile, fleeting and momentary, fashioned
expressly for them, inviting them to share the instant&#8217;s
joy. As they walked they drew closer together. They
were no longer blissfully happy, moving in a thoughtless
perfection of shared and reciprocated love. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
intelligently happy, perceptively, hopefully happy.
To the delight of the moment and of each other was
added the delight of anticipation. They walked on and
looked down the long vista of the future.</p>

<p>Their love had now a meaning and a purpose for
both of them that transcended the dear comradeship
and pleasure of the present. It was still love, but it
was not the same love; it had in it a sense of obligation,
an instinct of fidelity, a passion of service, an element
of devotion. In a little village church they knelt together,
reverently, before the altar, and the same prayer
was in both their hearts.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">PART FOUR</h2></div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">HER oldest child, a boy, was fourteen when Mrs.
Guy Vanton lost her husband.</p>

<p>They had lived together for a little more than
fifteen years. The newspapers of those years contain
nothing to show or suggest what may have been wrong
in their lives. If there was anything it did not show
outwardly.</p>

<p>In the files of the Patchogue <i>Advance</i>, to be sure, the
patient searcher might come upon a record of the death
of Keturah Hand, only sister of John Smiley and a life-long
resident of Blue Port. The article referred to her
as the widow of Hosea Hand, who had lost his life three
years earlier in an endeavour to save seamen from the
wreck of a three-masted schooner, the <i>Sirius</i>. The
<i>Advance</i> did not recall the details of this tragedy, no
doubt because they were familiar to almost all its
readers. Hosea Hand, with a rope about his waist, had
gone into a maelstrom of pounding surf at the foot of the
sand dunes, a maelstrom in which several dark bundles
of what appeared to be water-soaked clothing were
clashing about. The bundles were human flotsam,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
three poor devils washed from the rigging of the
<i>Sirius</i>. Before Hosea Hand could lay hold of a single
one a big piece of floating timber, part of the ship&#8217;s
fence, struck him. He never recovered consciousness
after being hauled inshore.</p>

<p>The tragedy had its effect on Keturah Hand in a perceptible
loss of the rude vigour which had always
characterized her. She failed very fast.</p>

<p>Keturah Hand left more than $200,000 which passed
to her brother, John, keeper of the Lone Cove Coast
Guard Station, and this was settled by him upon his
daughter, Mrs. Guy Vanton, with whom, after he quitted
the Coast Guard service, he lived until his death. The
closing years of John Smiley&#8217;s life were years of quiet
happiness. He had a comfortable home, he had his
daughter, and he had about him her four children. The
oldest was named for him&mdash;John Smiley Vanton.</p>

<p>The father of the four children perplexed those
youngsters vastly more than a father ought to do. Guy
Vanton was quiet, self-contained, sometimes a little
dreamy, rather quickly responsive to people and occurrences
about him. Fashioner of several small
volumes of verse which had received some discriminating
praise, he was also the author of at least one play
which had met with indifferent success. &#8220;At least one
play,&#8221; for he never wrote under his own name and
never used the same pen name twice; which may have
been the result of modesty or of something else, lack of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
confidence, perhaps. Once or twice when those who
knew him ventured to tax him with this peculiarity he
smiled and said something about &#8220;changing personalities.&#8221;
His wife, and possibly his father-in-law, could
have been the only persons to fathom his odd behaviour.
They knew that Guy Vanton considered himself a
nameless man, something less than human, a misshapen
legacy of a past at once monstrous and oppressive.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of oppression in the world, but
the one that is never completely overthrown is the
oppression of memory. Nothing could entirely displace
from Guy Vanton&#8217;s life the first thirty years of
it&mdash;thirty years, the entire formative period in the
human existence.</p>

<p>The mould in which Guy Vanton had been shaped
was broken just before his marriage with Mary Smiley,
called Mermaid, but that was too late. The plasticity
of youth was gone. And after a thing has begun to
&#8220;set&#8221; what matters is not the shape but the material.
Clay is often very beautiful, it has some exquisite colourings;
it remains clay.</p>

<p>In a characteristic fit of melancholia Guy Vanton
executed a deed by which he placed all his property in
trust for his wife and his children. And having by this
act safeguarded them so far as a man may, the man
wrote a few lines informing his wife of what he had done
and dropped out of sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Mrs. Guy Vanton&#8217;s closest friend, at the time of her
husband&#8217;s disappearance, was Tom Lupton, the Tommy
Lupton of her girlhood, who had succeeded her father as
keeper of the Lone Cove Coast Guard Station. She
went to Tommy&mdash;she had, very humanly and naturally,
to go to someone&mdash;to tell him the news and talk over
with him what should be done. She felt that she could
the more honourably do this as Tom and her husband
had been firm friends from the time, now many years
ago, when seventeen-year-old Guy Vanton had thrown
fifteen-year-old Tommy Lupton three times in a wrestling
match of an unexpected character. Mary Smiley
Vanton knew all about that match and knew the occasion
of it, which had been herself. She was not self-conscious
enough to suppose, however, that the outcome of that
encounter in a clearing in the woods joined to certain
sequential events had kept Tom Lupton a bachelor all
these years. If she had thought about it at all she
would probably have argued, quite justly, that the life
of a Coast Guardsman on the Great South Beach is not
favourable to marriage.</p>

<p>&#8220;This has not hit me so badly as I should have
thought it would,&#8221; she confessed to her old friend as
they sat together in the living room of the house John
Hawkins had built, almost a century earlier, for himself
and his wife. &#8220;Nor so badly, I am afraid, as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
ought to hit me. Which is a wicked sign, or a sign of
wickedness, I suppose. Not a good sign, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Tom Lupton wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;when things are not as
bad as we expect them to be we generally think them a
good deal better than they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom Lupton turned over the implications of this
remark in his mind for several minutes. At length he
asked: &#8220;I imagine you have decided what you want to
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Vanton let her hands fall loosely in her lap.
They had been hovering for a moment over dark red
hair, as heavy in its coils, as full of sombre brilliance, as
it had been on the day of her marriage to Guy Vanton.
The milky whiteness of her skin was not suggestive of a
woman nearly forty. Her face was unwrinkled and
her blue eyes were keen; reflecting, not reflective. Only
in the look of her mouth was there some slight alteration
indicative of the passage, not so much of time, as of
experience.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are only two things to do, of course,&#8221; she
answered. &#8220;One is to search actively for him, and the
other is to accept the situation. Were I free to do so
I think I should go out and try to find him. That
might be against his wish but I should feel I had to do it.
But I am not free. There are the children, four of
them. They are my children as well as his, and I must
do my best for them. I&#8217;m sure that he wanted to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
his best for them, and he must have believed that in
acting as he has done he was doing it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused and looked at Tom Lupton expectantly,
as if waiting to be prompted further. And indeed, this
may subconsciously have been her need of him. It was
not so much that she needed his advice and counsel, in
all likelihood, as that she needed someone who by a
listening presence and by an occasional question or
comment would help her to think the thing out and
reach and record a clear conclusion. Her friend may
have been aware of this. At any rate, he said: &#8220;Poor
old Guy! I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s to blame, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>For an instant she was horrified by a conjecture.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean that you think he was not himself?
That he was&mdash;out of his mind or anything like
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man hastily disclaimed any such idea.</p>

<p>&#8220;I only meant,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that the person who is to
blame is that old beast who brought him up.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this reference to Captain Buel Vanton she shuddered
slightly, then said: &#8220;Yes, of course. But that
would be a hopeful augury. Jacob King disappeared
and Captain Vanton turned up in Blue Port. It was
as if Dr. Jekyll had triumphed over Mr. Hyde.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d hardly call Captain Vanton a Dr. Jekyll,&#8221; Tom
Lupton dissented.</p>

<p>Mary Vanton went on: &#8220;I think my husband wanted
to remove from our children&#8217;s lives any trace of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
darkness in which he himself grew up. He had, as you
know, his moods of profound dejection, never lasting,
but liable to make us all unhappy with the sense of
something that could not be shaken off. It wasn&#8217;t his
fault. Had the children been older it would not have
mattered so much. But, as you know, they all worshipped
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the idea of helping her past this obstacle the
man said: &#8220;You have made up your mind what you will
tell them&mdash;the children?&#8221;</p>

<p>She made a sound of assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;To John, the oldest, I shall tell part of the whole
story. I shall tell him of his father&#8217;s boyhood and of
Captain Vanton&#8217;s life here in Blue Port; I shall simply
tell him that Captain Vanton was an insane man whose
idea was that the world was so full of wickedness that
no boy of his could be trusted in it; and so he kept his
boy tied closely to a dreary old house with two old
persons in it, the one always sick, the other insane. I
shall tell him&mdash;John&mdash;that his father has never got
over that experience, that the memory of it was what
made him so unhappy from time to time, that he realized
that these spells made everybody about him unhappy
and worried. Then I shall tell John that his
father, unable to overcome these feelings, has simply
gone away. I shall tell the boy that we may never
see him again, that he may come back some day
entirely recovered and well and cheerful, or that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
may see him return ill and old and unhappier than
ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;That much I can say to my oldest; but I can and I
shall say much more, and of greater importance. I
want to impress upon him that he <i>is</i> the oldest and that
I now have no one nearly related to me upon whom I
can depend except himself. He must be as much of a
man for my sake as he has it in him to be.</p>

<p>&#8220;Later, of course, I shall tell him more. I want to
tell him now enough to awaken in him the sense of responsibility.
As for the incentive to live up to that
responsibility, that exists in myself, his mother, and
his brother and two sisters, younger than he. The
other incentive, which would exist if we were poor or
penniless, I can&#8217;t create for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she continued, thoughtfully, after a
moment&#8217;s pause. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Perhaps I ought
to spend every cent I have&mdash;<i>I</i> have; you know I can&#8217;t
touch Guy&#8217;s money&mdash;in hunting for him. But&mdash;I&#8217;m a
mother. The instinct of the mother is to guard everything
for her children. Money, and other things. I
can&#8217;t go away on a hunt that might last for years and
leave them. But what is most important is this: If I
go looking for Guy what will the children think of
their father? What shall I tell them? Won&#8217;t they
think of him as a sort of guilty fugitive, a deserter, someone
to be hunted and tracked down and brought to
some sort of justice? Of course they will. And how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
far could I keep the whole story from them? I&#8217;m
afraid there wouldn&#8217;t be much that they wouldn&#8217;t
quickly know, and what they didn&#8217;t know would be
matter for dreadful guesses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Their whole young lives would be dominated by
their father&#8217;s act and the things that lay behind it,
things they must not know until they are older. Their
whole young lives would be shaped by the circumstance
that their father ran away from something&mdash;or to
something.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom Lupton, smoking quietly, looked up at her at that.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was really running away to something and not
from something, I think,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Mary Vanton developed this idea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Decidedly,&#8221; she assured him. &#8220;The only thing
that Guy could have wished to run away from was the
past; and there is no escape from that except in the
present. The future doesn&#8217;t count, can&#8217;t be made to
count for the purposes of escape. Guy was running
away to the present&mdash;the present outside himself.
Outside of us here. Out in the world he will find something
that he ought to have had in the past. I feel
that, even though I can&#8217;t say just what it is he will find.
It amounts to this, I think: he will get a new past, and
when he has got it he will bring it back to us. He will
come back to us entirely reconstructed, the same and
yet quite different.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was glad, with the gladness of a sincere and honourable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
friendship, to see her choice of the alternatives
that awaited Guy Vanton, who might conceivably, but
not very probably, return.</p>

<p>&#8220;The younger children I shall tell as little as possible&mdash;and
that what John and I decide upon,&#8221; Mary Vanton
was saying. &#8220;I am going to take all the children
and go over to the beach house for the summer. It will
give everything a chance to settle, including ourselves.
I am glad now that we built a really comfortable house
on the beach and I am glad it is at some distance from
any of the beach settlements. It is not too far from
Lone Cove for you to get over rather frequently to see
us. With the boys you can help me a lot. Then in the
fall I shall send John to school and I may take the
younger children and go away somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom Lupton rose. She offered him her hand and he
shook it warmly. She smiled at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Tom,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You are a good
friend, and you have helped me as much this day as in
all the rest of your life put together.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a second an impulse to tell her how much he had
always wanted to help her nearly took him off his feet.
A slight quiver passed along his tall, broad-shouldered
frame, and beneath the browned surface of his cheek a
muscle moved slightly. His voice was the least bit
husky as he said: &#8220;Any time. Any time at all. Send
for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went out, quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>The unaccountable gray eyes of John Smiley Vanton
looked straight at his mother as she talked to him.
They saved her a good deal. In a way they offset the
black hair and the snub nose which made him so strongly
resemble, outwardly at least, his father. And there was
something wonderfully cool and strong, to the mother,
in the grayness of those boyish eyes. Granite colour.</p>

<p>&#8220;You aren&#8217;t telling me everything, mother,&#8221; said the
boy.</p>

<p>She admitted it. In extenuation she promised that
when he was older he should know the rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, John, it really isn&#8217;t all mine to tell. If your
father were dead it would be different. But there are
some things which it is his right to tell you, and to be
the only one to tell you, while he lives. Suppose he
were to come back in a month or a year; then he could
take it up with you himself, and that would be much
fairer.&#8221;</p>

<p>He considered this and approved it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought to tell you this,&#8221; his mother added, &#8220;there
is nothing that dishonours your father in what I have
not told.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know it all?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Everything there
is to tell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know all that there is to know,&#8221; she assured him,
gravely.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>With this he was satisfied. They then spoke about
his sister Keturah, who was two years younger. &#8220;You&#8217;d
better,&#8221; John told his mother, &#8220;tell her just what
you&#8217;ve told me. She&#8217;ll hear it, anyway. Guy and
Mermaid are only ten and six and don&#8217;t matter much.
I&#8217;ll talk to Guy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The masterful assumption of responsibility toward his
younger brother pleased Mary Vanton. She checked
an impulse to fold him to her. She offered her hand
instead and he shook it, manifestly proud to conclude a
compact of equals.</p>

<p>Keturah Vanton listened to her mother&#8217;s explanation
silently. Tears stood in her eyes, but her anxiety
seemed to be mostly for her mother. She asked her
no questions but kissed her with fervour. Ten-year-old
Guy heard what his older brother told him with the
incuriosity of a person engaged in an intensive task of
teaching a new dog old tricks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Play dead, Dick,&#8221; he commanded. Dick obeyed by
rising hastily and loping away. At which six-year-old
Mermaid burst out crying as if her heart would break.
For some time afterward she appeared to entertain the
appalling notion that her father had disappeared rather
than play dead.</p>

<p>Mary Vanton lost no time in settling her house in
Blue Port and taking her family over to the beach.
She and her husband had what was by no means the
most expensive house on that sand barrier separating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
bay and ocean, though it had always seemed to both of
them the most comfortable. It fronted squarely on
the ocean, bulwarked and protected by a tall and grassy
line of dunes. There were a half dozen bedrooms and,
on the ground floor, two immense living rooms with
fireplaces. The house was constructed with unusual
care and was habitable even in winter. And it gave,
to the everlasting joy of those whose home it was, on
the veritable sea. For the eternal Atlantic, the &#8220;Western
Ocean&#8221; of sailors, is a breeding ground of men.
A cleanser and sweetener of continents and islands, the
ocean of storms and the ocean of victories, at once the
world&#8217;s greatest highway and the last, the perpetual
frontier. A sight nowhere transcended!</p>

<p>Mary Vanton often looked upon it. It renewed in
her the sense of wonder, the sense of mystery, the feeling
of hope, without which the soul is extinguished, without
which the very heart of life dies.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Tom Lupton got over to see the Vantons at least
twice a week through the summer. And whether she
was on the wide veranda or sitting under a beach parasol
on the sand while the children bathed in the surf, Mary
Vanton was always glad to see him. Sometimes she
found herself looking forward to his coming, and then
she had a moment of hesitation and self-rebuke. Yet
... why should she not? She expected a visitor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
in September and contemplated his coming with a
pleasurable interest, as she told Tom Lupton.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be glad to see Dick Hand again, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;
she asked, as they sat on the beach together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, sure,&#8221; Tom answered, with some surprise.
&#8220;Is he coming out?&#8221; Dick was still in New York, a
chemical engineer of tremendous reputation. His latest
feat had been to develop some old and neglected
patents that were his father&#8217;s. The rights had nearly
expired when Dick got to work at them and made improvements
that enabled him to re-patent them. He
thought he was going to make a fortune&mdash;or another
fortune. He had several already.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are those patents of his, anyway?&#8221; asked
Tom Lupton, rather perfunctorily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, they are processes with oyster shells by which
he makes a sort of concrete that can be used for flooring,
and some other substance that is good for roofs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom Lupton grew interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are those the patents he got from your aunt?&#8221;
he inquired. &#8220;I mean the ones his father got from
her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. What were those?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary Vanton had never heard the story, but Tom
Lupton had, and he related how Keturah Smiley, later
Keturah Hand, had bested Richard Hand, Sr.</p>

<p>Mary Vanton heard it through and then exclaimed:
&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t that like Aunt Keturah? I&#8217;m glad, though,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
that Dick is going to make something out of the
patents.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems almost as if you really had a stake in them,&#8221;
commented Keeper Tom. &#8220;Your aunt gave them
away, practically, if they are worth anywhere near
what Dick seems to think they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no; I have no right of any sort in them,&#8221; she
disclaimed, quickly. &#8220;Aunt Keturah must have parted
with them with the full consciousness of their possible
value. She would never have realized anything from
them nor would I. Besides, the greater part of their
value has probably come as a result of the work Dick
has done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose he is married and has children,&#8221; said
Tom, absently. Mary glanced at him with equal indifference
as she responded carelessly:</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>Dick Hand at forty-two had, as has been said, a
tremendous reputation and an equally tremendous
dissatisfaction. The one had no perceptible relation
to the other. Of the one the world was thoroughly
aware, of the other it was not. His dissatisfaction was
known to Richard Hand alone.</p>

<p>There were times when it swayed him absolutely,
When it &#8220;came over him,&#8221; and he could not get away
from it. He could not have told you what it was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
really; for sometimes he felt it to be one thing, sometimes
another. Now it was an immense discontent with
all he had done or was doing, now it was an unreasonable
irritation with life itself.</p>

<p>Everything, he found at such times, was worthless.</p>

<p>One day, in a fit of absolute disgust, he went to a
specialist. He had no expectation that the man could
help him, but he had got where he must do something.</p>

<p>He had expected to be shown into a darkened room
where a fellow more or less dressed for a part would
take his hand gravely, as if performing a rite, and then,
retreating to the distance and becoming semi-invisible,
would intone questions in a ceremonial voice while the
conversation was written down on the wax tablets of a
silently travelling phonograph.</p>

<p>But the office was as unlike that as possible, and so
was the specialist.</p>

<p>A bright room with a sort of sun-parlour on the south
side, a place of wicker furniture and cretonnes, with
books and magazines lying about and tobacco on the
table. With his eyeglasses and a sober seriousness of
face when in repose, the man who received him was
hardly distinguishable from a business man of comfortable
habit, moderately large affairs, and fairly frequent
preoccupations. They shook hands; the specialist
offered Mr. Hand a cigarette and took one himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s come out here,&#8221; he said, indicating the sun-parlour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
&#8220;It&#8217;s pleasanter and the chairs are better
to lounge in.&#8221;</p>

<p>They disposed themselves and puffed away for a moment
or two.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come to see if you can help me,&#8221; explained
Dick Hand, rather desperately. The other nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I get fairly sick of&mdash;existence,&#8221; Dick went on.
&#8220;I&#8217;m restless and rottenly dissatisfied, and I don&#8217;t
know why. Nothing seems to mean anything. I have
these spells, and they are commoner than they used to
be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me all about yourself,&#8221; suggested the other.
&#8220;Only what you call to mind and only what you care
to tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dick hesitated. &#8220;I thought,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that you
people asked questions&mdash;to get at certain things hidden
from us of whom you ask them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we do that,&#8221; admitted the specialist. &#8220;But
it usually is better to hear a man&#8217;s own story first.
After we have got the things a man readily recalls,
comes the problem of getting at the things he doesn&#8217;t
recall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose the idea is the relief afforded by making
a clean breast of things,&#8221; hazarded Dick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not entirely. It goes beyond that. It aims at
relieving unsuspected pressures. There&#8217;s a sort of an
analogy in a physical injury, such as a fracture. The
man who has the fracture knows that something is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
wrong, he suffers intense pain, but he doesn&#8217;t know that
a bone is broken, or, if he does, he doesn&#8217;t know just
where, nor how to set it. And he suffers too much to be
able to find out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s certainly a fracture somewhere in my
life,&#8221; said Dick Hand, grimly. &#8220;And I suffer. And I
don&#8217;t know where it is or how to set it.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a little pause he entered upon his story. It
was when he had entirely finished and sat silent that
the specialist spoke again.</p>

<p>&#8220;You say you were once in love?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the only time I ever was in love,&#8221; replied
Richard Hand. &#8220;She was two years younger than I.
We more or less grew up together. We were both in
our twenties when she refused me for good and all.
She was already in love with another man and she was
married to him a little later.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You use the past tense. Is she dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, she isn&#8217;t. She is alive and has four children.
Her husband has disappeared lately, left her and the
children. By the way, he would make a case for you!
If you could cure him I&#8217;d say you could cure anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t we who cure,&#8221; explained the other man patiently.
&#8220;We no more cure a man than does the surgeon
who sets a broken bone. We just try, like him, to
get things straightened out so they can cure themselves.
Tell me about her husband, who has disappeared.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dick recounted Guy Vanton&#8217;s story. It was a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
recital but the specialist seemed interested. At the
end Dick asked: &#8220;What do you make of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a bad case,&#8221; thoughtfully, &#8220;but it isn&#8217;t hopeless.
It might even come out all right. I&#8217;m afraid not,
though. If she&mdash;if his wife could not straighten things
out for him there isn&#8217;t much likelihood that anybody
else can. She must be a very fine woman. And they
genuinely loved each other. No doubt of that. Love&mdash;and
children. They are the ultimate satisfaction of
most men and women, but not of all. I imagine that he
is an exception to the general rule. There was something
else that he hadn&#8217;t got. Perhaps he will find it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A fine woman.... Love&mdash;and children ...
the ultimate satisfaction.&#8221; The words struck something
in Richard Hand. He looked up suddenly and
spoke in a harsh voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose if I had got her and if&mdash;if they were my
children...?&#8221;</p>

<p>The adviser looked at him gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think there is no doubt about it,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>They sat there in the gathering twilight for some
time in a silence fraught with the pain of a deep revelation.
Richard Hand struggled with the thing that stood
revealed to him and within him. After a while he said,
in words that seemed to choke him: &#8220;But what shall I
do? What&mdash;what <i>can</i> I do&mdash;about it&mdash;now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look the thing full in the face, as you are doing now,
and conquer it,&#8221; the other counselled.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>After a pause he went on to explain: &#8220;You love her,
you have always loved her. And because you love her
you will love her children, as a part of her. As long as
you suppressed your love for her, as long as you refused
to acknowledge it even to yourself, so long it continued
to punish you in other ways. It did not so act upon
you as to prevent you doing good work and profiting
by it; but when you had done great work and had
profited by it this suppressed longing stepped in and
robbed you of the reward you had earned by destroying
all the beauty and meaning of life for you, by turning
your victories to ashes in your mouth, by making everything
you were doing or had done or might do, pointless
and futile. For you the final satisfaction would have
lain exclusively in doing all these things for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why haven&#8217;t you done them for her? Why don&#8217;t
you? You can. You can make her yours and her children
your own. I&#8217;m not, of course, suggesting anything
disgraceful or dishonourable. I am suggesting that
you look the truth in the face like an honest man&mdash;though
you haven&#8217;t been intentionally dishonest with
yourself. Outward conventions are responsible for
most of the ingrowing minds. Look the truth in the
face like an honest man and fight the good fight like a
brave man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say to yourself&mdash;you won&#8217;t have to say it to her&mdash;just
this: &#8216;I love her; I have always loved her. I
always shall. I have done everything I have done for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
her, always, though I didn&#8217;t perhaps know it, and certainly
did not admit it. It isn&#8217;t wrong to recognize it
and it&#8217;s not wrong to admit it to myself; it&#8217;s merely a
piece of honesty, and it&#8217;s an outlet for what would
otherwise be suppressed and denied until it fouled and
poisoned my whole life. At the same time this thing
must be kept under control, just as any outlet must
be controlled. I mustn&#8217;t let it, in its flow, do damage
as great as it would in its stagnation&mdash;and a worse.
I must be as honest as the day about it and as strong
as I am honest.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>It was quite dark. The two sat there motionless for
a while. Then Richard Hand got up and came toward
the other man, offering him his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; he said, and his voice was boyish and
alive. &#8220;I think you have shown me a way out&mdash;if I
am strong enough to take it and hold to it. I&mdash;I think
I shall go and visit her&mdash;and find out.&#8221;</p>

<p>The adviser gripped his hand and shook it warmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go, by all means,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;Nothing is gained
by denial of the truth; nothing is gained by suppression.
Everything worth winning is won by fighting, and there
is no impulse in us which cannot be bitted and bridled
and curbed and made to serve us for a righteous end.&#8221;</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>It was like an Old Home Week, Mary Vanton declared,
when the three of them were all together on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
ocean shore in front of the beach house. Dick had come
down with the promise to stay a week and was living
at the Coast Guard Station with Tommy. At least
he was sleeping there and so, formally, Tommy&#8217;s guest.
Actually he was Mary&#8217;s guest and all his hours were
spent at her house or on the bay with her and the
children, or in the surf with the children. Except for
breakfast, which he and Tommy got for themselves, he
ate at the Vantons&#8217;. Tommy, too, contrived to spend
a good deal of time at the Vantons&#8217; and to take rather
better than half his meals there that week. Although
as Keeper he remained technically on duty at the Coast
Guard Station through the summer months, there was
actually little for him to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rather hard on the visitors,&#8221; he explained to
Mary about his absences, &#8220;who come over in droves,
mornings and afternoons, but even if I were there I
couldn&#8217;t demonstrate the use of the apparatus myself
without the aid of any of my crew.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three sat regarding the ocean in which the
four children were frolicking. The two boys could
both swim, but were wisely not attempting to do more
than duck in and out of the breakers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I shall stay here all winter,&#8221; Mary Vanton
said, suddenly.</p>

<p>The men looked at her, but neither spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have always loved the beach,&#8221; she went on, after
a little hesitation. &#8220;I have always thought I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
like to live here. We shall be comfortable and I think
it will be good for the children.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke in a matter-of-fact way. Tommy Lupton
wondered if she was setting herself a vigil of watching
and waiting against the possibility and improbability
of her husband&#8217;s return. Richard Hand also thought
of this, but decided&mdash;he could hardly have said why&mdash;that
there was something she wanted to think out, some
plan she wanted to arrive at respecting herself and the
children. Here, in a comparative isolation, she could
work it out for herself. It seemed more in her character,
somehow.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>When he left, Guy Vanton had in his pocket the sum
of $350. With part of this he bought a railway ticket
to San Francisco. He boarded the train, and as it was
evening, dined, retreated to the club car, smoked and
read for a couple of hours, and then went to his compartment.</p>

<p>The main thing was plainly to hit upon something to
do that would make a little money, enough for his
necessities, while he made acquaintance with the world,
the real world, the world outside himself, outside Blue
Port, outside his peculiar past.</p>

<p>It had taken him a long time to realize that what he
needed, what he must have if life were to become worth
living, was a touchstone in the shape of some direct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
experience, real and rough&mdash;something that would not
be eaten away by the acid of his thoughts nor carven
into gargoyles and grotesques, the chisellings of memory.</p>

<p>Guy Vanton was a poet. It was natural that he
should recall the lives and adventures of other poets,
and in the performance of Vachel Lindsay he found an
example of what he sought. Lindsay had gone about
the country with scrip and wallet preaching a gospel,
the gospel of beauty, exchanging his poems, printed on
slips of paper, for food and lodging. In the Colorado
ranges, along Southern roads to the doors of mountaineers&#8217;
cabins, by Kansas wheatfields, and over
stretches of prairie, from farmhouse to farmhouse Lindsay
had travelled&mdash;chanting, reading, conversing, discoursing&mdash;and
these adventures he had afterward
chronicled. Guy had no armful of poems to read in
exchange for food and a bed; he was certainly not the
possessor of a gospel that people would stop to hear.
He could not emulate Lindsay and the idea of doing it,
to give him credit, never entered his head. What
struck him was the fact that in America, at any rate,
there was still room for a pioneer. Americans find
something zestful and admirable in the spectacle of a
man breaking a new path.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>He was a long time turning the matter over in his
mind. And after it all, he could make up his mind to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
one thing only. He would go through with what he
had begun. This journey to San Francisco, for instance.
Once there he would look about....
He could, at any rate, go to the Federal Employment
Bureau, and see what he could get in the way of work.
A job. Something to do. Something to worry about.
Something two-fisted, hard ... but not hopeless.</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>He got it. Lying in San Francisco Bay was the
British ship <i>Sea Wanderer</i>, of Liverpool, a vessel of
2,000 tons, old and rather disreputable in appearance,
ready to carry such cargo as she could get and make a
precarious profit for her owners. Soon she would be
scrapped. That is, if she did not go to pieces first.</p>

<p>And yet despite the clumsiness of her outline, with
all her sail set, she was a beauty, a perfect swan of a
ship; a swan with a streaked and dark and dirty breast
and body. She had loaded with grain at Port Costa
and now lay anchored in midstream waiting to get a
crew. The skipper, a Welshman of Cardiff, had a
charter to fulfil and was rapidly growing frantic. He
was shipping anything and anybody who offered. He
took a sharp look at Guy Vanton, noted the fact that
here was a man no longer young, noted the further fact
that this man no longer young was a person of intelligence
and education, found out that Guy had had no
sea experience, cursed a little, computed wages, remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
that Guy would be so many added pounds of
beef on a rope and took him.</p>

<p>The passage was from San Francisco to Leith in
Scotland. In the course of it Guy put on fifteen pounds
and came to a clear understanding with himself and at
least one man of the crew.</p>

<p>They fought, he and this other man, in the waist,
surrounded by a ring of seamen whose sympathy was
entirely against Guy and with the Scotchman, named
Macpherson. Macpherson was about ten pounds
heavier than Guy but made the mistake of clinching.
Whereupon Guy turned the fight into a wrestling match
and threw his opponent. Macpherson&#8217;s head striking
on an iron butt, there was no more battle in him that
day. Nor did he challenge Guy in the rest of the
passage.</p>

<p>Guy&#8217;s understanding with himself was as forcible and
as fortuitous. It was gained, as such comprehensions
are, in loneliness and in struggle. He got some of it on
the ship&#8217;s yards, striving with half-frozen fingers to
clutch the wet and stiffened sail. He got some more
of it as he lay at night in the tropics on the hatch, looking
up at a star-sprinkled and gently rocking sky. He
got most of it in the spectacle of his fellows, a race of
men dedicated to the achievement of a common purpose
for no real or visible reward. Certainly they did not
sail the seas for the sake of the few dollars it put in
their pockets. They could live more comfortably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
ashore in the easeful jails for vagrants&mdash;&#8220;with running
water and everything,&#8221; as one of them put it. They
were where they were for the sake of doing something
together. They would sail that ship from port to port.
They would sail her along a trackless path across the
eternal frontier of the ocean in a voyage without precedent.
Every ship, it came home to Guy Vanton, is a
<i>Santa Maria</i>; every sailor a Columbus. If they failed,
they failed gallantly; if they succeeded, they succeeded
in an enterprise bigger than themselves.</p>

<p>And they did succeed. At night, under the glare of
the arc-lights, alongside a stone quay at Leith they
stood, a patient little group up forward, and heard the
mate, standing on the fo&#8217;c&#8217;s&#8217;le head, address them with
the immemorial benediction of the sea, four words:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll do ye, men.&#8221;</p>

<p>A straggling cheer went up and they turned to the
shore.</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>Guy Vanton saw now what he had never seen before,
what he had come more than 15,000 miles to see: that
the world of men and women is a fellowship into which
all are admitted in such degree as they care to enter and
on such terms as they make for themselves.</p>

<p>Without any subtleties he perceived that the past
could bind him only in so far as he allowed it to do so.
It was not his father who proposed him for fellowship in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
the community of men and women, nor could his father
withhold that fellowship from him.</p>

<p>Nor his mother, nor anything that they had done or
left undone. With the birth of every mortal a new and
clean page is turned in human history.</p>

<p>Every man writes his own page. What had he
written? And he was getting out of middle age. There
was not so much more time left to write. Not so much
space.</p>

<p>He would go home to her whom he should never have
left; to her whose page opened facing his; to her, the
mother of his children, whom he had left to teach them,
unaided by him, how to write on the clean, white page.</p>

<p>Together they would work out something better than
themselves. What is written, lives on. What they
wrote would stand as a record, for better or worse, after
they were through inscribing it. The thing was&mdash;it
must be done together.</p>

<p>He wandered about Edinburgh for a week and then
shipped for New York from Liverpool. This was in
early winter.</p>


<h3>XI</h3>

<p>Before Richard Hand said good-bye to Mary Vanton
that September he told her frankly of his love for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not doing a dishonourable thing,&#8221; he insisted.
&#8220;If I tell you this, now, it is my right to speak and your
right to hear.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>Mary Vanton sat looking directly at him, the brilliance
gone from her blue eyes, the depths in them showing,
the depths in her showing, too, in the way she
listened, and the words she uttered. Her wonderful
hair, darkly red, lay framed against the white linen of
a chair covering, a chair with a tall back that seemed to
shield and protect her and bring out in relief the
milky whiteness of her fine skin, unchanged by the sun
and salt air, like a pure and unspotted marble.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, slowly, &#8220;it is not dishonourable. For
it is not myself, Mary Vanton, that you love, but the
girl Mermaid. I am not she. I am much altered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are Mermaid,&#8221; he said, simply, and in his voice
there was reverence.</p>

<p>She shook her head at this and seemed to fall to
pondering the questions his confession raised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your husband,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;has deliberately
turned his back. It is necessary that you should have
some material assistance. It will be necessary&mdash;from
time to time. I don&#8217;t mean money, but I do mean
counsel, advice, someone to talk things over with, help
with the children, particularly with the boys. Young
John, for example. He&#8217;s fourteen and you are sending
him away to school. You&#8217;re letting me take him and
you don&#8217;t know what it means to me!&#8221; Like most
people, Dick Hand was not ashamed to show feeling,
though he hesitated, embarrassed, before a revelation
of the depth of it. And this went deep. He lifted his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
head abruptly and his glance pierced the blue surface
of the woman&#8217;s eyes and sank silently to unfathomable
soundings.</p>

<p>In those strange regions they met. It was like the
embodiment of a fancy as old as Kingsley&#8217;s &#8220;Water-Babies.&#8221;
But it was not a meeting of sprites, not a
meeting in play. She was Mermaid; he was Merman.
She was the incarnation of youth for him; he was the
incarnation of dreams for her. Each saw in the other
something lost or denied.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are what I would most wish to be, were I not
Mary Vanton,&#8221; she was saying, evenly, and he found it
hard to believe that she was uttering the words, so
magically did they echo his silent thought. &#8220;Remember
that I, too, was a girl. I also studied&mdash;chemistry.
Call it alchemy&mdash;wonderworking&mdash;the miracle of facts
invested with the romance of their exploration and discovery.
In my simplicity and eagerness I dreamed
for myself a career.... You have had the
career.... In your simplicity and hopefulness
you dreamed for yourself the perpetuation of youth in
an ideal love and the renewal of youth in your children....
That&mdash;has been mine. I have had the
greater satisfaction. I have it now.</p>

<p>&#8220;But mine is the basic satisfaction. I have had, I
still have, an ideal love. I have my children. The
rest I can forego. The other dream I can have as a
vicarious satisfaction in the splendid work you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
done and are doing. You, on the other hand, have not
had the underlying satisfaction that has been mine....
These things cannot be undone. We have
to deal with them as they are. We have to make the
most of them, exploit them bravely, gallantly. It is
the feat of living which, I suppose, everyone is called
upon to perform.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; he said, affirmatively. &#8220;But you
are also partly wrong. I was your lover and am now
your friend; I love your children, and it is at least permitted
me to love them as if they were my own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are that part of me which it is still permitted
you to love,&#8221; she said, gravely. &#8220;And as a friend, as an
old friend, as my one-time lover, as the realizer of that
part of my dream which I in my own person never can
realize&mdash;as such you are near and dear to me. Between
us there exists a strong tie. I do not think that anything
will ever break it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is unbreakable and it exists. It can be no
different, it need be no stronger,&#8221; he avowed.</p>

<p>A few moments later she heard him on the veranda,
talking with her oldest boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll swim you a hundred yards in the bay and beat
you,&#8221; he was saying to John in a youthfully challenging
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re on,&#8221; replied the fourteen-year-old, concisely.
&#8220;Say, you can&#8217;t do it, though!&#8221;</p>

<p>They moved away and their voices dwindled. Mary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
Vanton listened to the attenuating sound of their
movements and chatter. A great thankfulness filled
her heart, and when she rose from the chair where she
had been sitting, motionless, tears were in her eyes.</p>


<h3>XII</h3>

<p>But Tom Lupton was not articulate. He walked
beside Mary Vanton, sat at her table, declined cigars
and apologetically lit his pipe instead, looked at his
hostess and old friend with something kindling in his
countenance, talked&mdash;the casual talk that there was to
exchange in cheerful barter&mdash;and said nothing of what
was in his heart. Yet Mary Vanton knew what was
there.</p>

<p>The same thing was there that had been in the heart
of the youngster, the boy, Tommy Lupton, she had
known. It would be there always. But his attitude
was different from Richard Hand&#8217;s. In spite of an
existence that gave him plenty of opportunity for thinking
things out there were things that Tommy never
would think out. He would only dumbly feel.</p>

<p>If he couldn&#8217;t think them out he certainly couldn&#8217;t
utter them in words. Without doubt he thought it
wrong to feel them. All his life he had loved Mary
Vanton just as, in a boyish way, he had loved the girl
Mermaid. But he did not realize it; would have
thought it a wicked thing in him if he had realized it.</p>

<p>His attitude was simple. Mary developed it one day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
and defined it for her own satisfaction&mdash;developed and
defined it for his unconscious satisfaction, too. He
would feel the better for it, she knew, though he would
not know why.</p>

<p>&#8220;What,&#8221; she asked him as they were walking along
the ocean shore together, &#8220;are you going to do&mdash;eventually?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom Lupton considered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I suppose I shall just stick along here,&#8221; he confessed.
&#8220;It isn&#8217;t much. It&#8217;s all I have to look forward
to.</p>

<p>&#8220;Other men,&#8221; he said, a moment later, &#8220;haven&#8217;t any
special thing to look forward to, either. Take the
fellows at the station. All the older ones are married
and expect to retire on their pensions some day and
take it easy. They&#8217;ve children. They can watch them
grow up. I&#8217;m not married. I&#8217;ll probably stay in the
harness as long as I&#8217;m able and then I&#8217;ll have to quit, I
suppose, whether I want to or not. I can watch other
people&#8217;s children growing up. I can occupy myself
some way. That&#8217;s what it comes to mostly&mdash;occupying
yourself some way&mdash;doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you marry?&#8221; If it was a cruelty he was
mercifully unconscious of it.</p>

<p>He looked straight at her and replied: &#8220;I&#8217;ve never
thought of marrying.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was literal truth. Mary Vanton understood that
instantly. He had, from boyhood, always put her clean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
above him. He had fought for her, a boyish battle, and
been defeated; and after that, while he continued to
feel the same way about her, while he continued to love
her, the fancy of adolescence maturing into the devotion
of the grown man, he had never figured himself in
the running. She had stepped outside of the circle of
his life, and when she reëntered it, it was as the wife
of another man&mdash;which was the whole story.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he was saying, with his admirable simplicity
and acceptance of the facts&mdash;so far as he recognized
them. &#8220;Of course I wish I might have married.
It would have been pleasanter. I should either have
been much happier or very much unhappier.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again he looked at her with his smile in which the
boy he had been was so clearly visible. When he
smiled the little wrinkles at the comers of his eyes, got
from much seaward gazing, made him look younger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m worried about you,&#8221; he told her, with the directness
that was to be expected of him. &#8220;Do you think
you ought to stay here this winter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I must,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;It&#8217;s not from any
idea of shunning people but because I have got to arrive
at some way of living. If Guy were dead I could make
an unalterable decision. With Guy alive I have to
consider the possibility of his return, the probability of
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You feel sure he will return?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite sure. If I thought he were never to return I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
would reconcile myself to it as best I could, make my
plans, and go ahead. Even then I should have to provide
for the fact that he might come back. But believing
as I do that he is sure to come back, and feeling
as I do utterly uncertain how long he will be away, I am
very badly perplexed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do anything?&#8221; he asked, wonderingly. &#8220;It
is not as if you had to earn your bread.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is more difficult,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;When you
have to earn your bread, and your children&#8217;s bread, you
are spared the necessity of any decision. You just set
about earning it the best way you can, and puzzle over
nothing except how more advantageously to earn it.
Or how to earn more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those are not my problems and I have everything
to be thankful for, no doubt, that they aren&#8217;t. And
yet&mdash;I wonder if it isn&#8217;t easier to deal with difficulties
under the pressure of necessity? Do you realize that
I have no necessity, immediate or remote, pressing upon
me to compel me to address myself to my problem,
to solve it?&#8221;</p>

<p>This was not so subtle but that Tom Lupton saw
it and said so.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d be better off, in a way, if you had to make
up your mind to something,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;But what
I can&#8217;t see is what you need to make up your mind to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary Vanton permitted herself a slight gesture of
spreading hands.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>&#8220;If Guy were to be gone but a short time, if I knew
that, could feel certain of it, I would simply stay here
and keep things as they are,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;The
children come first in any calculation I may make.
But if I knew he were to be gone for a period of years I&#8217;d
do quite differently. I&#8217;d go into something, something
where I could have them with me and where we&#8217;d all
be pretty constantly at work together. A big farm,
I think. I don&#8217;t know anything about farming, but
I dare say I could learn something about it, and surely
a boy like John could learn it from the ground up&mdash;or
perhaps farming is learned from the ground down,&#8221;
she finished, smilingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I am getting at is this,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;I feel
the need of productive labour. I am not a theorist
and I have no set of passionate political or economic
interests. But I count it a real misfortune that at this
crisis in my life I do not have to work for my living
and my children&#8217;s living. It would be better for me if
I had to, and it will be better for them if they are trained
to. Under the trust left by Guy I can&#8217;t impoverish
myself and the children if I wished to; and certainly
I don&#8217;t wish to. Money is an obligation, just as much
as any other form of property, and more than most.
The obligation is to use it as rightly as you know how,
as productively as you can. And that obligation
certainly isn&#8217;t discharged by filling our five mouths with
food and putting clothes on the five of us. It is rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
more fitly discharged by educating ourselves, but it can
only be fully discharged in the end by productive labour.
That&#8217;s the conscientious and dutiful view I take of it;
from the purely selfish view there is a good deal also
to be said for a big farm. We need a new set of interests
and healthful occupation. It needn&#8217;t be a farm, except
that I can&#8217;t think of any other productive occupation
where the children could healthfully bear their share.
I couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; she added, humorously, &#8220;organize a factory
for the five of us nor set up a factory in which we would
be much use to the world or to ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could carry out this idea, anyway,&#8221; Tom
Lupton meditated aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t feel that I could embark on anything of
the sort if I felt certain of Guy&#8217;s return within a
comparatively short time,&#8221; she corrected. &#8220;If he comes
back and approves of my idea we ought to execute it
together. That would be as it should be. If I knew he
were not going to return for five or ten years I would go
ahead. Because five or ten years would change all of
us so much that an absolutely new adjustment would
be necessary, anyway. And it would be as easily made
in an entirely different setting as in the old one but a
little altered&mdash;more easily, I have no doubt. You
must remember, Tommy, that after years of any absence
we always return to make rediscoveries. The
delight is in finding something essential and unchanged
in what is superficial and very much changed. If things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
are outwardly the same we are disappointed and stop
there with our disappointment&mdash;we never do get beneath
the surface again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Big Tom Lupton, with his simple way of viewing
everything about him, felt himself beyond his depth.</p>

<p>&#8220;How will you decide what to do?&#8221; he asked, finally.</p>

<p>&#8220;This winter will tell me,&#8221; Mary Vanton asserted.
&#8220;I can do nothing about it before spring&mdash;I won&#8217;t, at
least. If by spring I have received no word, if there
is then no indication, nothing to guide me, I shall have
to go ahead in my own fashion, take all our lives in
my own hands, run my own risks, make my own mistakes,
stand or fall by what I do and the way I do it.&#8221;</p>


<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>Richard Hand had taken John Vanton to a school in
New Jersey and had seen him settled there before going
back to New York to prepare for a job in Arizona.
The Western enterprise necessitated a long absence
from his office in lower Broadway, and made it improbable
that he would be able to see the Vantons for
nearly a year. But late in October Mary Vanton got
a letter from him in which he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Things are in such shape here that I think I shall be able to
run away for a couple of weeks at Christmas time, and if you
like I will go to the school and pick up John, who will be
coming home about then for the holidays. I am going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
invite myself to come and stay with you part of the time I
am East&mdash;the first part of it. After Christmas I shall have
to get back to the New York office and clean up some work
there. May I come?</p>

<p>I do not suppose you have heard from Guy, though I sincerely
hope you may have. I made some inquiries in New
York and did a little investigation by wire. Through a
friend in Washington I had a search made of records of the
Federal Employment Bureaus in some of the cities and we
found that under his own name he had been shipped on a
British vessel, the <i>Sea Wanderer</i>, of Liverpool, sailing from
San Francisco to Leith, Scotland. That was months ago.</p>

<p>The <i>Sea Wanderer</i> is an old ship, a squarerigger, and she
went around Cape Horn. Of course I inquired right away
about her and learned that she arrived safely at Leith after
a passage of five months&mdash;not very swift, you see. I wasn&#8217;t
able to find out what became of Guy after that, but he reached
Scotland all right, for there was no trouble on the passage
and no one was lost or died. He was paid off at the Board
of Trade office in Leith along with the rest of the crew.</p>

<p>He appears to have gone straight to San Francisco from
New York and to have shipped there on this passage before
doing anything else. The time interval is too short to have
allowed him to do anything else. It was not more than ten
days, apparently, from the time he left New York to the day
the <i>Sea Wanderer</i> sailed. The people at the Federal Employment
Bureau in San Francisco have no recollection of him.
They don&#8217;t recall anything he said nor what he looked like.
He was just one of hundreds of others they deal with every
day. The only actual identification, of course, lies in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
name, and it is highly improbable that the man who was shipped
on the <i>Sea Wanderer</i> was some other Guy Vanton. I
think that, in a way, you will be glad to know that he kept
his own name. It makes him seem more like a fellow going
about his proper business and not trying to hide or run away
from something.</p>

<p>He wasn&#8217;t doing that, I feel sure. He was just going after
something he hadn&#8217;t got. Let&#8217;s hope he gets it and comes
back safely with it.</p>

<p>John is a trump. I like that older boy of yours and
suspect he&#8217;s got great stuff in him&mdash;not that it surprises me.
As your boy I should be surprised if he hadn&#8217;t. I rather expected,
though, that he would say something about his
father, talk to me about him in some way, try to get my opinion
or something of that sort. But he never opened his
mouth on the subject. He&#8217;s self-contained without being
conceited. He&#8217;ll get on well at school. And whatever befalls,
when he gets a little older you are going to be able to
have real reliance on him. He writes me regularly and seems
to like the place and the fellows. I think he inherits your
taste for chemistry, and as I&#8217;m a chemical engineer he thinks
something of me on that account. In fact, when we&#8217;re
alone together it&#8217;s pretty much a case of &#8220;talk shop&#8221; for me
all the time. Not that I mind that! I never knew before
how interesting shop talk can be. And if I give him my confidence
he won&#8217;t withhold his. I wonder, anyway, if a certain
relation of friendliness and exchanged confidence and
shared confidence doesn&#8217;t come rather easier between two
people who aren&#8217;t joined by ties of blood. It has sometimes
struck me, from what I&#8217;ve seen of other men and their sons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
that the very fact that a man is a boy&#8217;s father somehow
makes it more difficult for him to come into a real confidential
relation with the boy&mdash;at times, anyway. For even nowadays
the father is more or less an embodiment of Authority,
more or less the sovereign, and intimacy with the sovereign
is not particularly easy. Since I have no real authority
over John he is rather more inclined to listen to my advice
and heed it. &#8220;If I were you&#8221; gets farther, lots of times, than
&#8220;You must.&#8221; Well, I won&#8217;t theorize about it; the fact is
what matters, and the fact is what gives me immense pleasure
and a sort of general gratitude that belongs to you and John
and things in general.</p>

<p>I wish there were some way of finding out what Guy did
after reaching Leith, but from the day when he left the Sailors&#8217;
Home there no trace of him appears. I have had the people
at the Sailors&#8217; Home questioned but he did not talk about
his plans. They remember him there rather distinctly&mdash;not
his personal appearance but the fact that he seemed to be a
man of education and breeding. When he left he took his
dunnage with him, which would make it seem probable that
he intended to go to sea again. If so he may be on his way
home now. I sincerely hope so. I not only hope he&#8217;ll come
back, but I hope he&#8217;ll come back as speedily as possible
and in his best estate, physically and mentally and spiritually.</p>

<p>Tell me what the girls would most like for Christmas
presents. And if there is anything I can get for you on my
way East let me know. John and I are planning to spend a
day in New York buying some gifts. What would <i>you</i> like?
I shall bring along a toy wireless outfit for Guy, Jr.</p></blockquote>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>Mary Vanton read this letter with attention. The
news it contained of her husband stirred her profoundly.
At first she wondered if the career of Captain
Vanton had had anything to do with Guy Vanton going
to sea; but after some reflection she concluded it had
not. Guy had always loved the sea, which was one of
the reasons they had built the beach house she was
living in. The sea had been a mutual bond between
them&mdash;the sea and the beach. Fully half of the verse
he had from time to time written dealt with the ocean,
and he and she had shared a certain interpretation of it,
that the sea was the last, the irremovable, the perpetual
frontier on which the race of men could renew themselves,
renew their hardihood, exhibit their courage,
their daring, their resourcefulness, their faith.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sea,&#8221; Guy had once avowed, &#8220;is the only frontier
that never vanishes and never recedes. Men
triumph over it: &#8216;A thousand fleets roll over thee in
vain,&#8217; and the same victory has to be won anew each
time a ship sets sail. Steam and wireless and all sorts
of other inventions make sea travel safer and easier
and swifter only in the long run, and in the case of the
&#8216;thousand fleets&#8217;&mdash;in the case of any single voyage or
any single ship the actual risks, the possible hardships,
the prerequisite of latent courage and absolute devotion
on the part of the men who sail her, remain exactly
the same as when the Phoenicians went forth in trading
vessels and shuddered to go beyond the pillars of Hercules,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
into the dark, unknown ocean that rolled away
to the end of the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>This, he had argued, and Mary Vanton agreed with
him, constituted the real immortality of the sea and the
undying freshness of its adventure. They both felt
that there was something in their attitude that wasn&#8217;t
a part of the ordinary landsman&#8217;s attitude toward deep
water. Both had been brought up in the tradition of
tall ships and men who manned them. It showed in
their outlook on life and their tastes in reading. Joseph
Conrad was the passion of both. Although they agreed
in thinking his greatest novel to be not a sea tale at all&mdash;&#8220;Nostromo&#8221;&mdash;they
were of one mind respecting his
finest story. Together they picked &#8220;Youth,&#8221; despite
the apparent preponderance of critical opinion in favour
of &#8220;Heart of Darkness.&#8221; Perhaps this was because
in their own lives they had their heart of darkness;
and in Guy&#8217;s case there must have been, in respect of
&#8220;Youth,&#8221; an inextinguishable yearning for something
he could hardly be said ever to have enjoyed in his own
strange and sad experience.</p>

<p>Much of all this passed through Mary Vanton&#8217;s
mind as she stood on the wide veranda of the beach
house, alone. The water was now far too cold for
bathing and the children had scattered to their own
devices. It was a chilly, sunshiny, October day. Hull
down on the restless horizon Mary could see a steamship
moving almost imperceptibly westward. By nightfall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
she would be at anchor off Quarantine. That same night
or the next morning her passengers would troop ashore
and add themselves to New York&#8217;s millions. And even
as she watched this liner creep along, not more rapidly
than the minute hand of a watch, a thin plume of smoke
on the eastern horizon announced the presence of another
vessel. So they followed each other, day in and
day out, going west, going east, seldom missing from the
scene for an hour. More rarely you saw a great ship
under full sail come up over the rim of the world,
move past with curved white beauty, and then sink over
the world&#8217;s rim again.</p>


<h3>XIV</h3>

<p>The vessel struck with the greatest suddenness and
with such force that even above the roar of the wind and
the thunder of the surf pounding at the foot of the dunes
the people gathered in the Vanton house heard the dull
crash and jumped to their feet.</p>

<p>Dick Hand exclaimed: &#8220;What&#8217;s that!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary Vanton answered with the thought that was in
all their minds: &#8220;A ship!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her mind ran instantly to the children, absurdly, as
if they were in danger.</p>

<p>Seven-year-old Mermaid, the youngest, was in bed
and was not likely to be awakened by sounds outside.
Keturah and the two boys were with Richard Hand
and herself.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>She spoke to the three of them with stern distinctness:</p>

<p>&#8220;Children, whatever happens, you mustn&#8217;t leave the
house. You mustn&#8217;t step off the veranda. The sea is
up to the foot of the dunes.&#8221;</p>

<p>She called the servant and governess and ordered
them to keep to the house and to help her.</p>

<p>Richard Hand was already at the telephone and calling
the Lone Cove Station.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Tommy!&#8221; they heard him say. &#8220;A ship
has struck just opposite the house. Wait a moment.&#8221;
He lifted his head from the transmitter and asked: &#8220;Can
you see anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re sending up rockets,&#8221; replied Mary Vanton.
She was at the window, the two boys crowding close
to her to look out.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s certain,&#8221; Richard Hand said into the telephone.
&#8220;We can see her distress signals.... All
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hung up the receiver with a crash and went to the
window to see for himself.</p>

<p>The utter darkness of the angry night was broken,
at a distance of perhaps 400 yards from where these
onlookers were clustered, by a stream of rockets, which
lit the blackness faintly for an instant and then expired,
making the night seem darker than before. The illumination
was not sufficient to disclose much of the
vessel but she seemed to be a schooner or ship with three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
masts. Not a large craft; something of about 2,500
tons and something more than 200 feet long, Richard
Hand surmised.</p>

<p>There was no sail on her that they could see. What
little she had been carrying must have been blown
from the bolt-ropes before she struck, and this, indeed,
had probably caused the disaster to her, forcing her on
a lee shore. The gale was from the southwest. It had
been blowing all day, with hail and snow flurries, and
it was bitterly cold.</p>

<p>Mary Vanton left the window and taking the servant
went into the kitchen. She dragged out a washboiler,
took from a cupboard a fresh can of coffee, emptied the
coffee in the washboiler, but not without measuring and
estimating, put the boiler on the stove and began pouring
in water.</p>

<p>She ransacked the pantry and sent her older boy to
the cellar. From that region John emerged bringing a
side of bacon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bread!&#8221; exclaimed Mary, and for a moment she
stopped in complete perplexity. Then a recollection
relieved her.</p>

<p>&#8220;John,&#8221; she told the boy, &#8220;go down cellar again and
bring up all the hardtack there is there. Bring it up
a little at a time. Don&#8217;t try to bring it all at once.
There&#8217;s plenty of that, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her attention was caught by certain preparations
that Dick Hand was making.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to join the United States Coast Guard on
a temporary assignment to active duty,&#8221; he responded,
grinning as he struggled to get into a pair of hipboots
belonging to her husband. Mary&#8217;s face showed a
moment&#8217;s dismay but cleared instantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tommy will appreciate it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d better,&#8221; Dick asserted. &#8220;Pretty way to
celebrate the holiday season, this!&#8221; But he changed
his tone a second later. &#8220;I ought to be kicked for
jesting about it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Think of the poor devils
on that boat!&#8221;</p>

<p>He had got into the boots and was wrapping an oilskin
coat about him.</p>

<p>John and Guy, holding the lookout at the window,
shouted: &#8220;The man on patrol is out here sending up
answering rockets.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keturah, dissatisfied, came to her mother&#8217;s side in the
kitchen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t I help here?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Break out some of the ship&#8217;s biscuit,&#8221; replied her
mother, perhaps unconsciously falling into sea speech.
Keturah began opening a box of the hardtack.</p>

<p>Having got under way the work of preparing food and
a hot drink for those who would soon be needing both,
Mary Vanton allowed herself a moment at the window
with the boys.</p>

<p>Above the steady diapason of wind and ocean came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
sounds of men shouting faintly. This was the crew of
the Lone Cove Station, dragging apparatus to the dunes
close by the Vanton house. A moment later Keeper
Tom Lupton came in, banging the door; that being,
indeed, the only way to close it against the force of the
gale.</p>

<p>Mary Vanton hastened toward him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall go around the house,&#8221; he said, without
wasting time in greeting her. &#8220;We can work better in
the lee of the house. It will be a wonderful protection
to us and if the line falls short it will be less likely to be
fouled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The whole house is yours,&#8221; Mary Vanton told him,
quietly. &#8220;Use it. Come and go as you like. I am
making gallons of hot coffee; there will be bacon and
bread or hardtack.&#8221;</p>

<p>He thanked her and praised her with a single glance.
&#8220;I must be getting outside,&#8221; he said, and left.</p>

<p>The boys had deserted the south window for one
looking east where they could see the life savers bringing
up their apparatus on the crest of a dune close by
the house. Their mother spoke to them:</p>

<p>&#8220;John and Guy, bring in wood and get some dry
wood up from the cellar and start fires in the fireplaces.&#8221;</p>

<p>They obeyed willingly enough. Mary went into the
kitchen and sped the servant and her daughter in the
task of victualling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>


<h3>XV</h3>

<p>It is bad enough to move Coast Guard apparatus
along the level ocean shore, dragging it through the
sand, but to move it back from the ocean, up and down
over the uneven line of the sand dunes, is more difficult
still. When the ocean is up to the foot of the dunes
and is biting angrily at their bases this difficult portage
has to be made.</p>

<p>The Vanton house was not more than a half mile east
of the Lone Cove Station, so the Coast Guardsmen&#8217;s
task was not as bad as it might have been in this respect.
Sometimes it is necessary to drag life boats mounted on
trucks, and all the other paraphernalia, for several miles.</p>

<p>To be able to work with such a base as this big house
right at hand was an immense advantage, and to be
able to work in the lee of it, more or less huddled under
its eastern wall, seemed a piece of fortune hardly less
great.</p>

<p>Everything else was about the worst it could have
been in the circumstances. The darkness was absolute.
The gale was of hurricane force, blowing at more than
60 miles an hour. It was early in the evening, not yet
ten o&#8217;clock, and there was all the night to fight through.
The barometer, as Keeper Tom Lupton well knew, was
still falling, and the height of the storm had probably
not been reached and would not be reached until
toward morning. The chance of the sky lightening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
until daybreak compelled a recession of the darkness,
was almost nil. The chance of the wind abating was
no better. And even should the night become a little
lighter and the wind lessen, the tremendous seas which
were assaulting the sand dunes and breaking over the
stranded ship would not go down. It takes hours after
a heavy gale for the sea it has kicked up to lessen perceptibly.</p>

<p>The wind, against which a man could sometimes
hardly stand or keep upon his feet, was not the worst
thing for those who had to make the fight to save life
from the shore. It was hailing intermittently and the
ice particles were fairly driven into the skin of men&#8217;s
faces like a peppering of fine shot. There was little
snow on the ground, which was a thing to be thankful
for. More, however, would come later when the wind
began to abate.</p>

<p>Keeper Tom marshalled his men and his machinery
as close as possible to the Vanton house. Within forty
minutes from the time he himself finished speaking with
Richard Hand, his men and his apparatus were posted
and he was ready to begin operations. In the meantime,
Dick Hand had bumped against him in the blackness
and shouted indistinctly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tommy!... Dick! Anything you want
... help you....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks!&#8221; the keeper had bawled back with his
hands on his old friend&#8217;s shoulders.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>The little cannon began booming and a thin line
began whipping seaward.</p>

<p>Nothing was visible. What those ashore would
have seen, if there had been light, was a three-masted
ship which had struck the outer bar and had been driven
past that until she lay on the inner bar, so far inshore
that it might have been possible to wade to her at low
tide in peaceful weather. The stress of her blow on
the outer bar and the pounding to which she had been
subjected in being driven past it, as well as the continuous
assault she was now under, had battered her
very badly. She had not opened up at her seams but
would, and at almost any instant. Her foremast had
been carried away completely&mdash;snapped off a few feet
above her deck. Some of her yards&mdash;the spars carrying
her sails&mdash;were gone; two of these dangled loosely,
menacing the lives of any one on her decks. But there
was no one on her decks. All hands had, of necessity,
taken to the rigging.</p>

<p>They could just be glimpsed by the flare of her
rocketing distress signals&mdash;little dark figures in the
maintop, in the topgallant crosstrees, in the mizzen
shrouds. They appeared not at all human. They
seemed to be nothing but slight lumps or warts on the
fine tracery of the rigging, the slender filaments of masts
and yards and stays, wood, wire and rope, limned
against the formidable blackness in which sky and sea
met each other and were indistinguishable.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>No boat, of course, could live for a moment in the
sea that was raging. The only chance was in getting
a line to the vessel. And in doing that every instant
counted.</p>

<p>The first shots with the line were useless, as was to
have been expected. It was necessary to determine
direction and drift, and to make a heavy and exact
allowance for windage. The ship lay directly south,
the gale was from the southwest. The line had to be
shot almost straight against the wind, which then
carried it to the south. But so shot, it became evident
that it was falling short. A heavier charge was used
and still the line fell short.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t stay here,&#8221; bellowed Keeper Tom who,
when he wanted to give an order, was under the practical
necessity of bawling it separately in each man&#8217;s ear.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to leave the lee of the house and go to
windward, well to windward.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was that they might not have to shoot the line
squarely in the teeth of the gale when the wind, getting
under it, lifted it high in the air and seriously shortened
the horizontal distance it travelled&mdash;like a &#8220;pop&#8221; fly
in a baseball game or a golf ball driven straight into
the wind.</p>

<p>Leaving the lee of the Vanton house was just another
hardship added to those they were already enduring.
All the apparatus was moved and a post was
taken on a dune well to the west. From this site better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
results were got almost immediately. The gale still
carried the line to the eastward but this could be allowed
for and the lateral journey of the line was not materially
lessened. After a few shots to get the wind allowance
the line was dropped squarely over the wreck.</p>


<h3>XVI</h3>

<p>Inside the house Mary Vanton, having assured herself
that there would be plenty to eat and drink when
it was wanted, having approved the work of her sons in
building roaring wood fires in the fireplaces, went upstairs
and began to overhaul bedding. In this she had
the help of the governess while Keturah and the servant
remained active in the kitchen. There was a great deal
of bedding in the house and Mary got it all out. Some
of it she carried down to one of the living rooms, requisitioning
John and Guy to struggle with the mattresses.</p>

<p>Then she went to her medicine closet and looked that
over. Most of the rough-and-ready remedies were there
in reasonable quantities. Alcohol, peroxide of hydrogen,
iodine, camphor, and so on. There was some
prepared bandaging and, of course, linen could be torn
up in strips. She bethought herself of stimulants and
was relieved to recall a half-dozen bottles of brandy in
the cellar.</p>

<p>Was there plenty of hot water?</p>

<p>What next?</p>

<p>Something new occurred to her always before she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
completed the task in hand. At length she went
through the house, upstairs and down. Everything,
she decided, was as nearly ready for the emergency as
it could be. The fires burned brightly in the living
rooms and the smell of coffee filled the place. In one
of the living rooms four mattresses were ranged on the
floor and had been made up with sheets, pillows, and
coverlets. In the other the large table had been cleared
of books and papers. A cloth covered it and it was
heaped high with piles of plates, with hardtack, with
some cold meat, with what bread there was, with cups.
In the centre stood several pots of coffee. In the
kitchen the servant was frying bacon, Keturah slicing
it for her. The governess had run upstairs to assure
herself that Mermaid, the youngest, had not been
wakened by all the bustle, or to quiet her if she had.
The two boys were replenishing the fires and between
times darting to the windows, now the south and now
the west windows. But they could see little or nothing
from either.</p>

<p>Mary completed her inspection and stepped to the
south window. It was at that instant that the lifeline
reached the wreck.</p>


<h3>XVII</h3>

<p>The line passed close to the mainmast and a stiffened
arm reached out and caught it, drew it inboard at the
maintop, some thirty feet or so above the wave-washed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
deck. There followed an interval of minutes&mdash;they
did not seem like hours but they seemed tragically long&mdash;in
which the two or three men gathered in the maintop,
which is a small semi-circular platform with barely
standing room for three, made various movements
making fast the line; and having guarded against losing
it they began slowly to pull its length in toward them.</p>

<p>The light line for firing carried to them a stouter
rope, bent to the end of it, and a block and tackle.
Eventually the block reached them and the people on
shore prepared for the running out of the breeches
buoy.</p>

<p>And all this dark and sightless while the distress of
the motionless figures lashed in the mizzen rigging was
something palpable, acute, and sensed without the need
of a single gesture, a single sign, a moment&#8217;s glimpse.
How were these unfortunates to avail themselves of
the breeches buoy even when it reached the ship? To
get to it they would have to unlash themselves, descend,
and cross the deck between the mizzenmast and the
mainmast and ascend to the maintop. To cross the
deck would be impossible. As well try to walk fifty
feet on the surface of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>It was not certain, furthermore, that those in the
mizzen retained any power of physical movement.
They did not shift their positions. Although they had
lashed themselves in pairs close together they did not
strike each other about the head, shoulders, and body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
as they should be doing if they had any vigour left, in
the imperative effort to keep from freezing.</p>

<p>Slowly, with a painful slowness, the line was got
ready for the running of the breeches buoy. And then
it was that Keeper Tom Lupton manifested his intention
of being hauled out in the buoy to the vessel.</p>

<p>There was emphatic dissent. The men pleaded with
him in shouts, shrieking arguments that the wind tore
from their lips and the great thunder of the ocean
drowned. These were not circumstances under which
he should feel impelled to go aboard; the risk of travel
either way was too serious for a single unnecessary journey
in the buoy to be undertaken; the line might not
have been made fast properly, in which event he
would be the first man lost; in the conditions that existed
he could do nothing when he got aboard, and
he would become merely one more man to be hauled
ashore.</p>

<p>These pleas were without avail. Keeper Tom admitted
that he &#8220;didn&#8217;t know what he could do till he
got there. The thing,&#8221; he added, &#8220;is to get there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dick,&#8221; he shouted in Richard Hand&#8217;s ear, &#8220;in any
case, I can&#8217;t do much alone. I can&#8217;t ask any of my
men to risk their lives by coming out on the next trip
out of the buoy. I&#8217;m not asking you to. But
men&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The racket of the storm made the end of the sentence
inaudible. Dick Hand did not need it. He flung his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
arm about Tom Lupton and bellowed: &#8220;I&#8217;ll be there.
Next trip out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keeper Tom communicated the order to his men. It
was not until Tom Lupton was in the buoy and moving
over the boiling surf at the foot of the sand dunes that
Richard Hand thought, with a shock, of Mary Vanton.
Three men in the world were charged, in varying degrees,
with some responsibility to stand by her and
aid her. One had disappeared and the other two were
about to jeopard their lives.</p>


<h3>XVIII</h3>

<p>He felt he must see Mary for a moment and speak
to her. He left the cluster of men on the dune and
hurried to the house.</p>

<p>He found her on the rug in the east living room. One
or two of the crew were warming their hands and
swallowing hot coffee in the other large room. The
men came over, not more than two at a time, at intervals,
to get thawed out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom,&#8221; he said, &#8220;has gone off in the buoy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I saw someone being
hauled out and I knew it must be he.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated, then told her.</p>

<p>&#8220;The worst of it is, I must go on the next trip. He
practically asked me to. And I said I would.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that for the first time in all her life, so far as
he could remember, she seemed panicky and likely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
for an instant, to collapse. He stepped hurriedly
toward her but she had got hold of herself and made a
gesture to keep him away.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no! I&#8217;m all right.&#8221; But she let John, who had
approached them, bring her a chair and she leaned on
it. The boy kept near them, regarding them silently.
His gray eyes were inscrutable but the look he gave his
mother was one of sympathy, and Dick Hand thought
that there was confidence in the glance that was directed
at himself. It somehow came over Dick that
this boy was a big factor in all their lives, potentially
at least. If Tommy and himself did not come back&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mary Vanton was calm and self-reliant again. She
motioned to Richard Hand that he had better drink
some coffee. He took the hand she offered him, waved
to John, and hurried into the other room, impatiently
swallowing the coffee and going out the door with the
two other men.</p>


<h3>XIX</h3>

<p>The buoy had travelled out safely and the half-frozen
workers ashore had seen the Keeper disengage himself
and clamber into the maintop. They had also seen
him help one of the crew into the buoy and had received
the signal&mdash;jerks on the rope&mdash;to haul away.</p>

<p>Hauling away with a will they brought to the top of
the dune, half-drowned by the upleaping surf as he was
borne shoreward, a sailor, one of the forecastle crowd.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Two men picked him up and carried him to the
house.</p>

<p>As they cleared the buoy for the trip out Dick Hand
came forward to take his place in it. He put himself
in, first one leg then the other, and shouted: &#8220;All fast!&#8221;</p>

<p>They began hauling him out.</p>

<p>Out he went, not rapidly, out over the dark and
frightful tangle of waters that flooded the smooth
beach below him. He was facing shoreward. The
moment his feet left the edge of the dune he was, to
all intents and purposes, in the midst of an immense
void, a bottomless region of water and blackness and
cutting, stinging wind without landmark or landfall,
terrible, thunderous, and empty of anything but sound.
Beneath him the stout strength of the buoy bore him
up. That, at least, was tangible. It was as if he rode
slowly through chaos on an invisible steed, winged,
at home in the air.</p>

<p>A little way and then a great wall of water coming
unseen out of the darkness rose and curved and fell upon
him. One instant he sensed its black, glittering height
at his back, the next he was in the midst of it, as submerged
as though he had been a thousand fathoms below
the immense Atlantic; an instant later he was free
of the barrier, drenched, drowning, water running off
him in streams&mdash;riding slowly seaward, riding slowly
on.</p>

<p>The line carrying the breeches buoy was as taut as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
was possible to make it but inevitably it sagged in the
middle, especially when the buoy was bearing a man&#8217;s
weight. For a part of his journey Dick was under
water almost continuously. He had to hold his breath
and draw breath as cautiously as a swimmer in a heavy
sea. The impact of waves bruised and shook him, the
roar of the water deafened him. He could see neither
ship nor shore. He grew doubtful, almost, of his own
existence. Still he rode on.</p>

<p>As he neared the ship he was lifted above the angry
flood that seethed about the vessel. Now he went forward
more slowly, for he had to be hauled not only out
but upward. Eventually he found himself hard upon
the ship&#8217;s maintop, her torn rigging, singing deep bass
notes in the wind, all about him. A little farther, a little
farther, yet a little more and he was able to reach out his
hand and clutch a ratline. A moment more and he was
struggling to get his feet on the tiny platform of the top,
Tom&#8217;s hand was under his shoulders, and Tom&#8217;s voice
was in his ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine work! Good boy! You&#8217;re just....&#8221;
That much Tom&#8217;s voice managed to get to him above
the awful noise.</p>


<h3>XX</h3>

<p>Mary did not see Richard Hand&#8217;s trip out in the buoy.
She was busy ministering to the first man ashore, the
sailor whom two of the Lone Cove crew had brought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
the house. One of the men hurried back to help haul
the buoy; the other stayed and, aided by John, stripped
the sailor of his wet clothing and got him into night
clothes and a bathrobe. He was unconscious.</p>

<p>Mary, arriving with a bottle of brandy, poured out a
drink and they managed to get it down his throat as he
revived.</p>

<p>He sat up and looked about him stupidly and pathetically.
He was a big fellow with blond hair and blue
eyes, a Scandinavian, apparently. After he had swallowed
a little more brandy they put him in one of the
beds in the living room which Mary had converted for
hospital purposes. He did not appear to be frostbitten
and, closing his eyes, he fell into a slumber that was not
much lighter than the unconscious state in which he had
reached the land.</p>

<p>Mary stood for a moment regarding the first&mdash;and it
might be the only&mdash;life wrested from the clutch of the
sea. He was handsome in a way and evidently not very
old. A mere, overgrown boy, she thought to herself, but
he might not be so young as he looked with his light hair
and fair skin, almost beardless. He came of a seafaring
race, whether Norwegian, Swedish, or Dane; he would
not think very deeply of his adventure. She wondered
for a moment what he thought about the sea, how he
felt about it, how he would feel about it now; but she
reflected that his escape would probably present itself
to him as a piece of luck, nothing more, as something all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
in the day&#8217;s&mdash;or the year&#8217;s&mdash;work&mdash;nothing romantic
about it.</p>


<h3>XXI</h3>

<p>Mutely, working together on the slight foothold that
the maintop afforded them, the few boards beneath
their feet shaking to the tremendous violence of waves
breaking over the decks below, Tom Lupton and
Richard Hand got first one and then the other of the
two men on the maintop with them into the breeches
buoy and sent them ashore. In the rigging above, close
to the topgallant crosstrees, were two other figures.
But even as they worked, getting their second man into
the buoy, one of these black huddles that was a man
dropped past them and struck the deck with a noise
distinct and apart from the noise of the general tumult.
In the spectacle of that hopeless black clump falling
down past them, in the sound of that blow as it struck
the deck, in the quickness with which the shape was
swallowed up by the glassy black of the ocean, raging
with frothing crests, there was something to make the
bravest soul momentarily faint and turn the body sick.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going after the other,&#8221; said Keeper Tom by
gesture. And by gesture Dick inquired if he should go,
too. Tom Lupton shook his head. &#8220;Stay here,&#8221; he
ordered, and started up the ratlines.</p>

<p>From below, fearful and anxious to aid him but feeling
the obligation to obey orders, Dick Hand watched.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>The keeper went up slowly, the wind flattening him
against the weather rigging. Dick saw him gain the
crosstrees and moving toward the lashed man begin
work with a sheath knife. After some moments the
keeper got the man free. The fellow was so little able
to help or move about that the keeper abandoned an
evident intention to carry him down the weather rigging
on his back. He slashed about with his sheath knife,
and Dick could make out that he had cut some sail rope.
This he proceeded to tie about the man, fastening it
under his shoulders and knotting a bowline. Very
slowly, very cautiously, working on the weather side,
the keeper began to lower the man to the maintop. It
was a perilous enterprise and was only managed by turns
of the rope around a shroud; and it took minutes. But
it was accomplished and Dick received the man safely.</p>

<p>He contrived to get the fellow in the buoy and away
while Tom was climbing carefully down.</p>

<p>There remained now the great problem of the people
on the mizzenmast. The deck was impassable. Not
only that, but the ship was beginning to break up. Her
bow had been bitten off raggedly by the sea. It was
impossible to tell where she would split or when. She
might break in twain amidships. In that case the mainmast
would almost certainly go by the board, Dick and
Tom would both be lost, the connection with the shore
would be broken, and in all likelihood not another soul
would reach the beach alive.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>They had rescued four. There were three on the
mizzenmast. A full half of the crew had certainly been
drowned, some, perhaps, going down when the foremast
had broken off.</p>

<p>Something like a miracle happened as Dick Hand and
Keeper Tom stood together again in the maintop, having
sent four men ashore.</p>

<p>A wave of unusual height rose up, shone inkily
against the blackness of the sky, curled, and burst, burying
the poop deck completely and falling with all its
might against the base of the mizzenmast. There was
a noise of splitting wood and of rending stays that rose
above the loud song of the wind in the rigging, and with
a tremendous crash the mizzenmast fell. By some
freak of circumstance it fell straight to windward, and
the wind and some resisting fibres of wood at the point
of fracture retarded its fall. It came down slowly, tearing
through the outer main rigging to windward, the
mizzen topmast shearing things down. For the moment
the mizzenmast rested squarely on the main upper
topsail yard halfway out, then as the ship rolled slightly
it came inboard and close to the mast. Dick and Tom,
watching anxiously and in terror, waited to see what it
would do. But it had done what it had to do. There
it rested, close to the mainmast, supported by the main
upper topsail yard; there it seemed destined to stay for
no one knew just how long&mdash;perhaps ten seconds, perhaps
ten minutes, perhaps an hour.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>But the inexplicable chance which had broken off the
mizzenmast and laid it carelessly, like a match, diagonally
against the mainmast and close to the maintop had
shaken from their lashings two of the three human
figures that had been visible on it and had brought the
third, and only remaining one, almost within arm&#8217;s
reach of the two rescuers.</p>

<p>There was no trouble getting him free and into the
maintop where the buoy was waiting, empty, ready to
give someone a ride to the shore.</p>

<p>He was immovable and partly frozen, lifeless or
nearly so. One would not have judged that there could
be much chance of saving him even if he were got ashore;
but that was not a question to take into consideration.</p>

<p>The wind howled, the sea made an indescribable
noise. The two could just manage to strap the man
to the buoy and give the signal to haul away.</p>


<h3>XXII</h3>

<p>Ashore, in the house, Mary Vanton&#8217;s foresight and
careful preparation were being vindicated, and the
facilities that she had at her disposal were being taxed
to the limit.</p>

<p>Four men had been brought ashore in the buoy. All
four of them had to be stripped of their clothing and
partially reclothed in dry apparel. All four needed
brandy, coffee, food, none of them was in a condition
to receive. Of these and of the Coast Guardsmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
some were frostbitten and had to be rubbed with snow,
others had cuts and bruises that required attention.
Two were delirious, and for these she found some sedative;
no one, herself included, ever could remember
afterward what it was. One long living room did
really resemble a hospital ward. The other living room
resembled a free-lunch counter in unusual disarray.
Food was beginning to play out, but of hot coffee there
remained a plenty for all.</p>

<p>Keturah and the servant tended to the food and
drink, except that Mary herself kept charge of the
brandy. The governess was busy with bandages and
liniments; John stood watch over the patients and
ministered to them as best he could, helping his mother.
Young Guy, exhausted from the excitement, had been
carried at last, half asleep, to his bed and simply dropped
upon it with his clothes on. Through all the excitement
the youngest child, Mermaid, had slept without
waking. It was now two o&#8217;clock in the morning.</p>

<p>The door opened, for the one hundred and thirty-first
time, perhaps, that night, and two Coast Guardsmen
stumbled in carrying the lifeless body of Guy Vanton.
Mary Vanton looked upon it without a tremor, kept
control of herself absolutely until it was certain that he
was dead. Then she had him carried into her room upstairs
and herself covered his face. She came out
quietly and turned the key in the door, slipped it into
her pocket, and started downstairs.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>Something in her expression sent terror striking
right through the heart of her first-born. John was
beside her, had kept beside her from the moment when
his father&#8217;s body was brought in. His arm went about
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother!&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped uncertainly on the staircase and looked
at him. Her lips moved a little but she did not say
anything. Her foot slipped on the step, but she caught
herself by the handrail and then stood there in absolute
quiet. The boy looked at her steadily. Their eyes
met. She reached out her hand, with a weary effort,
and drew him close to her.</p>

<p>Dick Hand did his best to compel Torn Lupton to get
in the buoy, but could not. Tom, who had muscles of
iron, held back and at the same time gripped Dick with
a grip that meant business and thrust him forward,
yelling against the side of his face: &#8220;Skipper last! I&#8217;m
skipper here ... all there is.... Get in.
Wonderful work ... thanks....&#8221;</p>

<p>So Dick got in and was hauled back to land. He
made all haste to the house and got there to find Mary
Vanton at the foot of the staircase, her boy beside her.</p>

<p>At the sight of him she lifted her eyes, and they
showed some of their usual brilliance in the joy at seeing
him standing safely before her. She made a gesture up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
the stairs, took the key of her room from her pocket, and
handed it to him.</p>

<p>Dick went up, not knowing what he should find. He
took a long look at the face of what had been Guy Vanton,
left the room, quietly relocking the door, and came
downstairs. Without pausing for warmth or coffee he
hurried out into the storm. He must be on hand when
Tommy landed.</p>

<p>He gained the top of the dune and looked seaward.
It was still two hours or more to faintest daybreak.
Out of the blackness beyond the signal to haul away
had been received. The men began hauling.</p>

<p>Just what happened is a matter of conjecture.
Whether the whole ship dissolved in pieces all at once
or whether the mainmast, weighted by the fallen mizzen
carried away and fell, it can never matter. Of a sudden
the line bearing the buoy collapsed into the water.
With shrieks, yells, prayers, and frantic effort the men
of the crew, Dick helping them, hauled away as for
their lives&mdash;it was, most certainly, for one of their lives,
the best, the worthiest. But the falling line had become
entangled in floating wreckage; there was no light
to see what had taken place; after a succession of mighty
efforts the line snapped and they hauled inshore nothing
but a frayed end of rope. Tommy Lupton, who had
been keeper of the Lone Cove Coast Guard Station,
who had risked his life to save a few poor sailors,
Tommy, forever a boy, forever dreaming of doing some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
act of bravery, simple, devoted, courageous Tommy, had
fulfilled his hope and gained his desire.</p>

<p>There is something priceless in the world. He
possessed it.</p>


<h3>XXIV</h3>

<p>There was no more to do that night, although some
of the crew remained always on the dune until day,
dawning, showed no trace of a vessel, but only traces
of where a vessel had been, pieces of wreckage floating
about. The wind had gone down; the sea was still
high but would soon begin to lessen in violence. Already
snow was commencing to fall. It fell all day,
mantling the dunes, covering all the external marks of
the night&#8217;s horrors, a great winding sheet laid upon
the trampled ground. Only where it struck the black
and restless sea did the white blanket fail to disguise
what had taken place&mdash;that which would take place
again and again, from generation to generation, as
long as the sea rolled and men sailed.</p>

<p>But even the snow did not go on falling, stopping at
dusk, and the next day it was fair. The sun shone and
the air was warm&mdash;the weather might have been that
of late spring. And on the day following it was equally
warm and pleasant; and this was Christmas.</p>

<p>Richard Hand remained with the Vantons for two
weeks after Christmas. At length Mary Vanton decided
to close the beach house and spend the rest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
the winter in Blue Port. Richard Hand saw her settled
there and then, with her reluctant assent, took John
back to school.</p>

<p>He had postponed his own work, let it drop, let it
wait, let it go! Work could not matter just then.</p>

<p>But after he had left John at school he returned to
New York and pitched in as hard as he could. It was
some time before he could get away to run down to
Blue Port, but at last he managed it.</p>

<p>Mary Vanton met him at the little station, smiling.
All the way to the house he was conscious of nothing
but her presence beside him. When they stood together
in the house, alone, facing each other, something
dynamic swept over him. He could hardly see, and
tears sprang to his eyes. He felt himself suffocating,
drowning in a sea of feeling. The Mermaid of immortal
youth who lived on in Mary Vanton was folded in his
eager arms.</p>
